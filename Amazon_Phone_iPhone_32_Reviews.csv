I have tried amazon technical support and although helpful and nice they couldn't solve the problem.  Turns out some countries don't allow phones to turn off their camera sound, meaning we got a phone that was meant for another country.  Returning again and trying eBay!"
"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",6-Feb-18,3,battery,"It works, and it's clean. Professional packaging and it arrived fast.Downside, the battery must have not been replaced because it won't even last half a day idle. Good thing is that at least this isn't a waterproof phone and I can easily buy a battery replacement kit for less than $30 on Amazon. It really would've been great if they put new battery so it won't suffer on performance due to shit iOS's ""get a new phone or your old phone will be slow"" tactic aka BATTERY GATE. I figured I would run into a problem like this since it's a refurbished one anyway. It's impossible to know the performance and battery life without activating the phone. I bet a lot of people have this problem but who would actually return it once it's activated? But hey, I'm not paying a thousand for a new phone and I bought an iPhone knowing there's an ongoing battery gate controversy so I'll just suck it up and won't even bother sending a complaint.But, I chose to give it 3 stars since the price wasn't bad, it seems easy enough to replace battery, and it doesn't cost that much to buy a battery kit.  I don't ""like"" it, but it's okay."

After a few uses the screen began to be unresponsive from time to time.  We have turned the phone on and off several times and the problem has continued and is now occurring with greater frequency. The screen is now unresponsive about 50% of the time. remains inactive The home button, volume controls and off button still work and the phone responds to them, so we know the phone is still working, but the screen just isn't responding. Tried it with the screen protector on and off, and the outcome is the same. Really disappointed in this transaction and would request an exchange or refund."

"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",7-Mar-18,3,Test Your Phone Fully/Siri Cant Heat Me...,"When i received this item it was in perfect shape with no scratches or defects; to the naked eye at least. After about a week, i realized that Siri couldn't hear me unless connected to headphone/bluetooth device. Thought this could be a software issue, because the iOS for the X had just come out and I didn't drop the phone or get it wet. All that being said, i still gave the benefit of the doubt to the seller for running all the necessary test to be ""certified refurbished"" . Then last week i took Apple up on its 29$ battery exchange program and told them about the Siri problem i was having and they took a look at it. They ran some test and said my front mic (aka Siris ear) wasn't working and that it was a hardware issue and that they often can go out with regular use. This isn't a huge problem for me as i dont use Siri that much (especially now), but i know a lot of customers who would and be very upset by this. Just be sure to fully test your phone, and be sure not to let the window pass for returns/exchanges.  2.5 Stars."

"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",17-Jan-17,1,Rip OFF. I am so disappointed!!,"So I have to revisit because I think that this purchase was tantamount to a RIP OFF. I previously reviewed that phone worked well and that's because I hardly used. I had it as a back up just in case my galaxy edge powers down. Recently my galaxy broke and I tried to use this iphone and I can barely swipe the screen to unlock.  The phone has never fallen and it's still in the state in which I purchased it. If I were to do it again, I would never buy a refurbished phone. I'm just soooooooooooooooooooo mad.Works beautifully. Few scratches here and there and dirt in side groove when received but overall very good.d."

I kept thinking how cool it was that I bought this normally so expensive phone for such a good price. I soon found out this phone is terrible: The screen freezes, the screen's sensitivity is awful (sometimes it opens apps I haven't even touched or types on its own) and the screen is so hit-or-miss that I had to get rid of my password entirely because there were several instances where I could not get into my phone. I would press the 1 button and it would type 0 or 7 and would put random numbers in until it actually disabled itself. Having had this experience, I now understand why more people don't buy refurbished cell phones. While it seems really cool to have the latest technology at a discounted price, I think full price is worth having a fully functioning device. While I am keeping the phone (because I am unable to return it!!) , I am very unsatisfied and I will not be buying a refurbished phone (especially not from this seller) again.If I could give this a 0-star rating I definitely would. I am so frustrated with this phone and cannot believe I spent so much money on it."

I think that more time should be placed on warranty for devices such as this because after I started having issues where it was constantly shutting down I wrote them to see if I could have it exchanged or pay more to trade for a 6pl or 7 they basically told me the time had pass and the sale was final and nothing else could be done to assist me.Even if you don’t see fit to assist me based of time or whatever I really thought it could have been handled better.. the customer service level is very poor and didn’t really appreciate how my situation was handled and to date I’m still having issues with the phone but this is just my lesson learnt...

Dead after 9 months.  Battery is dead and nothing will make it go. Tried all the online 'iphone not responding stuff'.  Tried the hard reboot, reset, etc.  Cleaned the charging port (it isn't dirty and doesn't look damaged).  So, looks like we'll roll the dice on a battery swap and pray it's not money down the drain.

My iPhone came with some scratches near the volume button along with near the charging port. Aside from that, my battery was in very poor condition dying whenever it would reach 20%. I did all the troubleshooting suggested thinking it was maybe the software, but the problem continued. I wouldn't waste your money. You are better off buying a brand new unlocked iphone from Apple for just $30 more. Not worth the hassle."

"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",13-Feb-18,1,"Lousy crapped up phone, doesn't work much of the time and the company is a tax evader","Apple evades taxes by pretending their profits are in the Caymen Islands, Northern Ireland... well, they move them around on paper so you and I are stuck with their bills.  To keep this a secret, now they have filed in court 150,000 euro fines against French protesters at their stores.  TAKE THAT TRUTH, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.  Apple says screw you, America, California.  They have profits to hide; taxes to evade.My freaking Iphone more than half the time does not work.  It jams, stall, touch screens don't work, or flips to settings that I'm always saying how the hell did that happen.  They have junked it up with so much crap, it's a lousy phone."

Honestly I should have returned it, but was afraid it would be argued that the crack was caused by me."

"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",9-Dec-15,4,I am very satisfied of the improvements of the iphone 6,"Belinda42 The iphone 6 is a long lasting, good quality, and durable phone. The phone comes in many varietys of colors, and the Apple company is frequently ugrading the style of the phone.Concerns:One of my concerns with the iphone itself is that it is very skinny and can cause the iphone to crack easily if not taken care of properly. If I were you, I would buy a Lifeproof case to prevent the phone from cracking. If the phone cracks, I would bring it to a company so the crack doesn’t grow bigger and ruin your phone entirely. This product is like an ipad but you can text and call on it.Positives:The iphone is an apropriate size that can fit in your hand, and it also has a large screen. The camera on the phone can take good quality pictures and videos, leaving you with a fantastic picture. Also the iphone has an excellent battery life, and it can last up to one to two days without needing to be charged. I can use my phone often throughout the day lasting me all day. I prefer people who are older than 10 should have an iphone. The iphone 6 is a great phone. I use this product everyday with no problems. It is a high qualitly phone with many beautys that makes my life a lot easier. If I were you, I would go buy the iphone 6 asap."
