"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","February 20, 2017",5.0,ABOUT FREAKING TIME!!!! UPDATED POST!!,"Over the years, I've tried maybe 6 Blu phones. All of them looked amazing, but we laggy to the point it drove me nuts and if take them back. I just got the Vivo XL2 and I'm absolutely happy with this phone. It's freaking stylish as usual, but it has tons of bells and whistles like a more expensive phone, and so far it works amazingly  well. I can't believe how nice this phone is for the price. Unreal. And ignore the 64 gig SD card limitation. It took my 128 gig no problem at all. LOVE MY NEW PHONE!!!  If Blu keeps this up, I'll keep buying Blu.I've had it for a week now and I still love it. It only got better. I failed to mention that this has quick charge, and comes with a case and arrives with a screen protector on the phone, with no bubbles or junk under the film. It also comes with an extra screen protector. I can't say how much I love this phone for the price paid. So happy with it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 7, 2017",5.0,Open Honest Review,"People love to get a new phone and,  while riding that new tech high, get on Amazon and shout ""BEST PHONE EVER""  when obviously it's not.  Here is my open honest list view of the Pros and Cons of this phone.Pros:Price: Even at the suggested retail of 149 usd, this phone out performs the price tagBuild quality: Built like a 700 usd flagship device. Manages to look both beautiful & professionalCall quality :  Perfect, which means it does what a phone is supposed to doScreen: at 720p its NOT as nice as an iPhone or Pixel, but it does look amazing on the 5.5 inch screenAntenna: Most forgotten feature of reviews... This phone has service in the basement of the hospital I work at, on both on Tmobile AND AT&T.  Having duel Sims,  I decided to put in both my personal and work sim cards in the phone. The Sony Xperia M5 Ultra I had before this got zero service for most parts of the basement.  This Vivo XL2 has at least 2 bars of 4g lte service through out the entire basement. Same sim cards, same Radio bands supported, and yet only this phone gets signal.Sound: loud and crisp, even with a back firing speaker.  I'd prefer a front facing speaker,  but oh well.Camera, both front and back:  Great cameras for 149 usd.... AVERAGE Camera for 700 usd.  So comparing the pictures to your iPhone or Galaxy s6 or Pixel pictures your gonna be disappointed most of the time. However, snap a pic in good lighting, share it to Facebook or Instagram, and you would be surprised how nice they look.Battery:  true 5 and 1/2 hours of screen-on time which is absolutely amazing.  However, though they claim its quick charging, it's really not.  2 hours to fully charge from 25% isn't standard quick charge, it's actually ""not slow"" charging at best.. LoLAnd finally IR blaster.  Not many phones have it anymore, but it's nice to be able to mess with the TVs at the hospital.  It's entertaining changing  the channel from Fox News to MSNBC, or vice versa, just to watch the brainwashed receptionists mind explode when someone actually disagrees with their world view.CONS:Skin/software:  Though its running Android 6.01 you'd be hard pressed to notice. The skin Blu decided to use makes it look and feel like a bunch of 16 year old kids tweaked it to something they thought looked ""cool"".  Easy fix,  use Nova or Google Now launcher and all is forgiven.Can't use duel sim and a MicroSD card at the same time.  Though the memory and ram upgrade (32gbs and 3gbs respectively) are more than enough for me, adding a 64 gb card will mean only using one sim card. As one slot is for a card or a sim.... It's not just this phone, but this is the one Im reviewing.No fingerprint scanner.  Can't use a lot of the new instant pay service without one.  Though at the 119 usd I paid for it, I can't complain to much.That's it with the cons. It's basically a phone on par with most flagship devices at a 1/4 of the price.I always buy unlocked carrier free versions of the phones I use as my daily driver.  The Vivo XL2 is without a doubt the best value I have ever gotten in a cell phone.  Is it the best phone ever??  Of course not.  Even Blu themselves sell better all around devices.  HOWEVER,  the XL2 may indeed be the best 149 dollar smart phone available as of March 2017."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","May 30, 2017",1.0,Update - don't waste your money!  A pretty solid four stars.  Could have been better.,"Update seven months in:  I've had to go from four stars to just one.  The phone worked well for about six months, though the shiny slippery back is very annoying.  But for the last month the phone has been almost unusable, and today it's become basically a brick. People who call me say they get busy signals. The phone itself freaks out. It will be normal, and then suddenly the app I'm using closes and the screen quickly flips through all the pages and then freezes on the add widget page. This happens when I'm just sitting there reading a Kindle book, typing a reply to a text, or browsing the web.  The phone will also suddenly refuse to accept input on the touch screen, or will shut down the keyboard when I'm typing.  I'll get a text, try to answer it, and the phone will shut down.  It's like it's gone insane or something.  I've tried everything, factory reset, all the updates, and even tried to get help from BLU.  All of my attempts to contact them were ignored.  Now I have to go out and try yet again to buy another phone!  I've had it with BLU and no longer recommend it.  I expect to get more than six months out of a phone!!!In the box :  phone, charger, wall adapter, headphones, screen protector, and silicone case.  Phone also had a screen protector already installed. This is my third BLU phone.  I'm disappointed that this one has a sealed battery, and if you do need two SIM cards, you can't use a  SD card.  There are only two slots, instead of three.  The fancy back that they make sound so awesome is anything but; it's not even really blue or shiny except in the brightest sunlight, and the surface is so slippery that the phone is hard to hold on to, and takes every opportunity to slide off the arm of the chair, the desktop, the nightstand, the dashboard, or anywhere else you might want to set it down.  It also has a few more quirks than my other BLUs  and was a little cranky over getting my favorite apps customized.  As much as the phone is an obvious attempt at an iphone clone, it doesn't seem to have as good an antenna as the iphone.  Meetings in an interior room in a large building mean I have no signal but I can hear coworkers phones getting texts.  That's not a huge deal for me as those meetings are only once a month and otherwise the signal is pretty reliable, and I didn't pay anywhere near $600 for the name brand.On the plus side, it does have plenty of onboard memory and readily connected with my net10 SIM card.  Apps work quickly, music sounds pretty good, and calls are clear.So overall a decent deal.  Just make sure you order a nice case when you order the phone, otherwise you'll be dropping the phone all the time, and the case that comes with it is an ugly whitish color that is just repulsive.A cautionary tale:  My first BLU phone was the  Life XL and I was very happy with it, all the utility of a $600 samsung or apple product at a fraction of the price.  Easy to set up and worked very well with my net10 account.  I""d still be using it if I hadn't dropped it on cement and made the display go all wonky.  The phone still worked just fine, but the screen was too blurry to live with.  So I ordered an identical Life XL.  Unfortunately that one came loaded with spyware. I filed a complaint with the seller, tojostore, but they refused to respond until I left bad feedback.  Then they quickly refunded my money without even asking for the phone back, so they know they were guilty.  Lesson learned, always buy just from Amazon, and immediately run a malware checker before putting any contacts or other personal information on the phone!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 3, 2017",1.0,Spyware still. Come on Blu get it together!,"Still has a security issue,waiting on Blu to respond 3 different malware detection apps,found stuff. Update: sent Blu screenshots of the all the stuff my spyware detection apps found stilllllll waiting for a response. (Update) 3-17-17 received email back from Blu they said their working on a update to fix the data breach, they better, this app Data ghost or data clone has super user permissions and can do whatever the heck it wants. I'm done with Blu forever This BS app even tryed to hide what it's doing"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","June 29, 2017",2.0,Absolutely amazing for this price range,"The first time it hit the ground the screen cracked.  I contacted BLU support who told me that there are no replacement screens available for this model.  The screen protector is the only thing holding it together.Included in the box is a 5v 2.0a charger, micoUSB cable, USB-OTG cable, earbuds with microphone, rubber phone case, screen protector, and one of those professional paper clips for opening the sim/SD card tray.  And, there was a screen protector already on the phone.The sim card / SD card tray is pretty flimsy, I wouldn't open it very often.  As other commentators noted, you can either have 2 sim cards or 1 sim card and 1 sd card.  You cannot have all three.The phone case does not fit correctly.  The lower right hand corner does not fully extend over the front edge of the phone, and it feels like the phone will slip out if I grab it by the case.  The case partially covers the microphone hole.There were a few Amazon apps pre-installed, but they had obviously been done so outside of the google play store as they would not update without asking the user to modify their app installation permissions.  Luckily, I was able to fully uninstall them.  After disabling what I didn't want and installing some basic google apps, it says I have used 11 GB of 32 GB.  Luckily this phone has not partitioned the main storage into multiple segments to simulate an sd card like the BLU studio energy.The display is stunning.  Good contrast between colors, very bright, and the curved edges are neat.Overall, I think this thing is perfect for $150.  But if you drop the screen, there is no replacement."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 25, 2017",5.0,Worth every penny!,"I have to give this 5 stars! For the price this is a phenomenal deal. I waited 2 weeks to write a review and I must say this is a great phone! Looks good, works really well, storage is terrific. I did download the Evie go Launcher because I didn't like the stock launchers but that is all! I am never spending 700 on a phone anymore as long as BLU makes affordable awesome devices like this vivo xl2."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","September 29, 2017",5.0,Excellent!,"Got it today as described It's very nice, runs smoothly can play games smoothly takes excellent pictures (at least to me it does). The sound quality is perfect, video playback is good it's fast and the storage is not bad just perfect for me. For the people who said that they couldn't see the symmetry on the back of the phone as it was showed/described in the picture I'mma say this...LIES...if you hold it up at an angle literally don't have too, but you clearly can see it. The last and only #1 CON about this phone is yea, its true...that you are not able to use your sd/memory card if you're using 2 sims (the standard sim and or the micro/nano sim) MEANING you won't be able to use sd/memory card if you're using BOTH. For me only using 1 sim (3-in-1sim) i can say it's possible this phone does have dual sim so therefore in other words if you're using 2 sim cards you won't be able to your sd/memory card, BUT if you're using 1 not 2 but only 1 SIM (which is the standard size sim) then yes you ARE able to use your sd/memory card. This is through my knowledge and what I've experienced using BLU Vivo XL2."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","April 5, 2017",2.0,"Nice phone and Price, but was does the warranty give you?","Okay, I got the phone yesterday (4/4/2017) and was amazed by the stuff that comes with it for the price!  Ear buds, phone cover, screen protector,  USB 2.0 cord and charger.. It's a nice and sleek looking phone. Has Android 6.0  Marshmallow with it.  But I didn't get long enough time to play with it.  Why is that? The metal bracket on the SIM card tray fell off!  So I contacted Blu about it. Provided them the info they requested and included a picture showing what I was discussing. In case they were not sure.  I was told that cause this happened. It was void of warranty! And then told I need to pay to have it repaired!  Not even 24 hours old and I need to pay to get it fixed! WTF?!? Then they told me why not just contact Amazon to get a replacement! At least when contacting Amazon, they immediately fixed the issue and shipped out a new phone and took the old one back!  But still hard to believe this company refused to fix the issue. Would not believe that their product could have a manufacturer error on it! Something like this, the metal piece coming off the sim card tray should not void the warranty. After all, people need to use it to pull out the sim card to gain access to the memory card one is using also if they want to replace that with a new and better one!I like how the phone looks and the stuff it comes with. But I can not comment on how it is as a device.  Maybe when I get the other one I will update this review. So please be warned when buying! It's a shame this company did this!UPDATE! Had it for many months. It’s okay. But I am pissed off with the few updates they did. It was to add spam and spyware! And you can’t remove it!  Also still has the Security issues!  And was to.d back in April that they would have update to Nougat. And still being told it’s coming! It’s now 2018 and still no update! Just more spam and bloatware to slow it down!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 6, 2017",4.0,Great Phone with a nice OS. Earpiece speaker is not as loud as I'd like.,Everything works great only downside is the earpiece speaker is quieter than my previous Note 4. I work in an office setting so its quiet in here even then the earpiece speaker is hard to hear unless pressed firmly against your ear.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 26, 2017",1.0,Good looking quick phone but don't drop it,"The os and speed is ok but do not drop it! I bought this phone for my wife a week ago and my she  was carrying it in her hand and bumped the car door and it fell around 2-3 feet to the ground and the screen shattered it was really disappointing for a phone with ""gorilla glass 3""  the phone is nice looking and pretty quick but if you drop your phone a lot then this isn't the phone for you. it took one drop in my case to become a paper weight"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","September 20, 2017",5.0,Good evening I have had the Blu VIVO XL2 for ...,"Good evening  I have had the Blu VIVO XL2 for almost three weeks now and  I must agree with  most of the people on here that this phone is great and for all those who are complaining. stop it  .  this is my third Blu phone in the last 7 years and each phone that I have brought from Amazon was better then the one before.  I have owned all the phones from Iphone  all the way down to the G-1. it takes a little time to get around and learn it but its fun doing it.  and you can buy  a  AMOR CASE WITH KICK STAND .  I will keep you inform .  but as of 9/20/2017 this phone is one of the best buys you can get for your money,Up dateIt's now the 27rh of September and my Vivo XL2 is working just Beautifully. Has been dropped and with the Amor case  didn't have to worry one second. Camera is great and a whole lot of fun. Total Charge in 2 hours. Fast operating  I read that the earbuds were no good. Man who ever said is deaf the ear buds sound just great great bass and really high highs. And the mid-range isn't a joke at all. Doesn't stall or slow down at all. And I charge my about every fourteen hours and for those who think  that's to Soo. Your nuts I'm on my phone all day long with no breaks. Bottom line you can't get a better phone then this for the price.  Thank you BLU for another great one"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","April 28, 2017",4.0,I really like the phone,"I really like the phone.  My only real problem with it is that the triangle and square navigation buttons are reversed compared to other phones that I have had experience with.  While this is a small thing, it is a nuisance.  I know that this is my own fault because you can see this on the pictures of it but I didn't notice.  I had another BLU phone and it lasted until the warranty expired (95-100 days).  I have had this one for a couple of months now and so far, no problems."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","June 7, 2017",1.0,Phone dies then overheats - BEWARE,"UPDATE :I have owned this phone for just over 2 & 1/2 mos, and yesterday it went blooey!The phone was sitting on a desk when it began to cycle through a reboot process - this happened several times before the reboot completed to where the phone could be used.I checked it out, and it seemed fine. but about an hour later it went totally dead during use - - it would not turn on nor recognize any charger, no light came on to even acknowledge that a charger was attached.Later, when *trying* to get tech support I went to get my SIM card out of the phone and it was HOT to the touch - ACK!!!The BLU support site is a nightmare - you can not leave an email to ensure they got your support request, just a phone number... and it took multiple attempts to get their system to accept a support ticket.I have yet to hear from them, and I have the phone in a cooler in the garage in a ziplock bag with plastic ice packs :(Are they using the same batteries as the Note 7?!?Former review when phone was working :If you want a phone for calls, messaging, and a couple of app games at a reasonable price, this is it.I received it running Android 6.0 (it has not yet updated to 6.0.1, and I suspect it won't)If you're used to Samsung (or LG, or whatever) bloatware, the stripped down version running on this will look good - until you realize what it *doesn't* do.It means fewer options.Yes, you can ad apps for that, but since these impact processing, it'll slow the phone down.And this phone can't handle much in the way of processing.If you use your phone more often than a laptop or home computer to surf the 'net, this phone will frustrate you.Open more than 2 or 3 windows, or if you have any other apps running in the background, the Vivo XL 2 will often freeze up for a few moments or go black briefly - the Blu version of 'little spinning circle, I suspect.Doesn't crash, just - annoyingly slow.Sometimes it will take so long to load a page, the phone asks if you want to crash your browser...Don't bother, just pretend you're on dial-up... And it happens whether I'm out of the house with full bars or on WiFi with strong signal.Don't waste your money if the 'net access matters, go for it if you just need a dumbphone.For me, this is a (hopefully) temporary replacement for a Note 4 until the Note 8 comes out.If I had to use this phone for more than a few months I wouldn't keep it.When I'm done with it, though, it'll be handed off to a WAY less picky household member.YMMV..."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","November 12, 2017",1.0,Something has gone wrong,"Loving this so far...lots of space and working great for me....I have only had it for several days now. My last Blu phone is still working and I had it for 3 years so I am hoping I get better results from this one. I just wanted a newer model.2018-01-20Updated reviewI have had this phone lest than 2 months and I seems to have shut down on me. A wireless update was done last night and from then the phone started to malfunction.....it was working great up to that point. I am so annoyed right now.....who is going to refund me or give me a new phone?.....it costs too much money to send this back from Barbados. I cannot access anything in the phone, make any calls or receive any.....it would not even power off but all I am seeing is a black screen with an orange line surrounding it nothing else......so frustrated....I paid over $400BDS for this phone.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","November 13, 2017",3.0,Not bad,"I've been using this phone now for almost 2 months. My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy s6. Overall, the phone is very nice. It has a nice, heavy feel. It takes decent pictures and I love the dual SIM option as well as the great storage and memory card slot. There were a few things that I found disappointing and it could just be that I'm comparing it to a much more expensive phone.For one, I don't like having ads on my home screen. I can live with it, but It's a pain.Two, the ringer volume is terrible. At It's max, I miss text messages all the time at work. Even when the phone is right in front of me. Yes my work is loud, but if my Samsung is in front of me, I hear a text.Three, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't personalize my home screen as nicely. I tried downloading several apps for themes and after they were added, I only got a background pic. I never got the theme icons. On that same note, I was disappointed that I can only change the size of the font, not the style.I was hoping to use the dual SIM feature to make this phone both my personal and work phone so I don't have to carry 2. But not only can I not hear the notifications well enough, I worry that the phone will not be powerful enough to handle dual phone tasks. I may upgrade to another phone and give this one to my 10 year old. She would be absolutely thrilled with it."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","August 16, 2017",4.0,Love BLU,"Bought one for my wife in April.  Impressed, so I bought one for myself.  Done a lot of research and looked at a lot of phones.  Can't beat this one for the price.  Comes with 32GB memory.  More that enough for a lot of apps.  Phones with less memory have not worked for me.  Have not had a problem with either one (one gold, one blue).  Have to charge it daily which is standard for most smart phones.  Comes with case and screen protector.  Wifi works extremely well.  Blu uses a charger that is unique to Blu.  Can buy extras at Amazon.  Used camera sparingly, but is great for my purposes.  Not hard to learn to use.  Similar to a lot of other brands.  Used it as a bring your own phone (BYOB)to Tracfone.  Had no problems activating it.  Used chat instead of calling.  Nice big, bright screen (5.5"").  Have down streamed baseball, movies, etc.  One negative is that if it is used with Bluetooth (headphones), it will only work for calls, not down streaming movies, music, etc. To do that, have to use plug in headphones.  Overall a very good phone.  Sleek, thin and has a very nice touch.,  Have had several people ask me about it when using in public.  Most have not heard of Blu."

So I had to deal with Blu support center, they insisted I perform a series of steps even when I told them the screen was completely black, after giving then serial #, purchased date, they insisted they want model number and a picture of the original box showing the bar codes and all that stuff. It took 2 days to get understand the information they wanted (because they insisted they need the model number) and I didn't know the model number it was the name of the phone. So finally they approved the verification and gave me address to ship phone (I had to pay shipping to their wherehouse) even though it was a defective device but they were kind to remaind me that if it was water damage or any other my fault I had to pay return shipping (just in case I wanted a broken phone back in my hands).

I used the Studio HD for about 3 years and it was noticeably slowing.  My wife has used the Energy 2 for over a year and it is still excellent.  The phones seem to come with an increasing number of junk apps, but a quick launcher upgrade relegates them to the junk drawer where they belong.  Overall the quality and hardware exceeds what I would expect for the money, making BLU's phones a great value.  I also appreciate that the company is Florida based while they are manufactured in Asia just like every other phone."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","April 28, 2017",5.0,Buy this phone.,"I had a Blu Vivo XL, which took a swim, so I got the new version.  I loved the first version, but I like this version even better.  GREAT PRICE.  Quality phone.  I am very, very pleased with it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","September 16, 2017",5.0,"Best phone I've owned, definitely worth the money","Let me start by saying that this is the best phone I've ever owned. I've owned about 8 phones, three of which were also BLU phones. I wouldn't say it's the best phone out there, but for the price... Wow.This phone does a lot for a phone that is only $150. It looks and feels great, it's pretty fast, and, best of all, comes packed with interesting features. It has a built in fake call app, for example, for when you need to slip out of awkward situations. Now that is something else.Back on a serious note, it's a nice size, in my opinion. Not tiny but not too big. I can hold and use it comfortably. Call quality is clear and I've yet to have any issues with connecting to WiFi or the cell network. The phone also comes with a case, a screen protector already on it (and no annoying bubbles!), And an extra screen protector, should you need it. It also comes with a charger, some sort of adapter (admittedly, I don't know what it is for, so refer to another review for that answer), and a pair of earbuds. For an audio guy such as myself, the earbuds sound quite disgusting, but for average users, they should be fine.The only issue I've had with the phone itself was when I first got it. It took some time for the phone to recognize my SIM card. That was a bit frustrating, but once solved, the issue never arose again. I will say, though, that if you need to use two SIM cards, you will be unable to use a micro SD as the Micro SD and one of the SIM slots are the same slot. For me, it's no issue as I only need one SIM, but I felt it worth mentioning. The phone has 32 GB of internal space, which is more than enough for me, so I don't even need to use my SD card.There are better phones out there, obviously. But you'll be spending at least $600 to get them. This phone is way too good for the price. Thank you again, BLU, for an amazing product."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 1, 2018",4.0,I absolutely love this! I don't normally do a review so ...,"I absolutely love this! I don't normally do a review so soon (after only two days). However, this has exceeded my expectations to the point that if anything went wrong at this point, it would still be a winner in my book. Where do I start? I'll start off with the bad. I didn't care for the launcher that they use. It's very juvenile. But I always use Microsoft launcher anyway, so it wasn't a big deal. The launcher that it comes with places all of your apps on the screen. Ew! But, as I said before, that's an easy fix! I love the fact that almost everything you need is on the phone without a million and one apps. You got your barcode scanner in your camera app. Someone should have thought of that ago. You also have the option to record phone calls through your regular call app. Never saw that before. Back to the camera. It's awesome for such a low budget phone! It's almost too good! Normally your front-facing cameras don't catch your pores so well. I'll be using touch up features for that part. Lol! I love the business card scan option. It lets you scan business cards into your contacts. The free updates to Nougat didn't go so well though! Tried everything but had to factory reset. That wasn't fun. The 3GB of temporary memory is everything! I never knew that was the reason my old phone wouldn't load content very well. I thought it was my data usage allowance giving me hell! The speaker is on the back. But, honestly, who plays media through the phone speaker anymore? It's a nice-sized phone with a pretty sleek design! The charger that comes with it charges pretty decent. However, battery life could be a little better! I live with chargers all around me. So, it's not a problem for me. Kinda comes with the territory. I haven't been able to find how to make the battery notification tell me my percentage yet. I'll keep looking. The option to ""close all"" at the recent task menu is everything! It keeps the phone clean and working fast without the hassle of swiping then one by one all of the time! I've said enough. This phone is worth it!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 9, 2018",4.0,"Good phone, disastrous update to Android 7","i have been very happy with this phone. UNTIL I gave in to the nagging and updated to Android 7. It deleted all my photos and downloaded PDFs, created strange-looking, strangely colored icons, deleted all my home screen bookmarks, made several apps unusable, and corrupted my 64 GB SD card so that it was unreadable either in the phone or on a PC and I had to throw it out. I had to restore the phone, which then automatically updated to Android 7. If you want to update to Android 7, back up all your data to a computer (i tried to back up to the SD card but couldn't do the PDFs or screen shots), remove the SD card, and restore the phone. Otherwise the phone works well and has a strong broadcast signal that I use as a hotspot with great success."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","November 26, 2017",5.0,Fantastic!,"BLU has become my new favorite. The camera is fantastic, it's easy to customize and comes with great preinstalled apps such as the Amazon app. The phone is easy to navigate and has terific battery life. The first phone I got had some blue tooth issues, but that went away with an update. (I got a new one because my son decided mine needed to be a fish. My second one did not have any Bluetooth problems at all) Also when I got my first one (almost 6 months before this review) there weren't alot of case options. Now there are quite a few unique case designs. I think BLU is a fantastic product and also decently priced. I've fallen in love. When it's time for me to upgrade I will go BLU."

The phone is sleek comfortable in your hands. It comes with headphones and adapter for USB a rubber case and a charger.Pros: large display, fast reaction on the keyboard.  Has 20Gb of true internal storage. The rest is preloaded apps that are embedded in to the store. Operating system is good no glitches and very responsive to the Android platformCons: no expansion on memory the speaker is located on the back side away from you. So if you watching a YouTube video on a table the sound may be muffled.Overall the device is a good product price point is Affordable and I received the phone probably in the mail with no issues. Try it out."

All in all, it does what I need it to do, so I'm satisfied with it.  Battery life is about 8 to 12 hours depending on how you use your phone.  If you play games, on social networks, etc.  It has the tendency to drain the battery quickly, but you can recharge the phone with the wall charger in about an hour.  Car charger takes a bit longer."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","September 1, 2017",1.0,Charging port issues,There are several things I don't like about this phone. However I will list the pros and consPros:-Large display-Very bright-Virtually no lag with normal everyday use-Large battery lasts me all day on one charge with light to medium usage-The cameras are decent.Cons:-LACK OF APP DRAWER(seeing all my apps on multiple screens is less desirable. Not to mention ugly since they are not in any specific order. A custom launcher is warranted.)-Less than adequate speaker.-bloatware(never had bloatware on Blu before)-Tends to heat up in the pocket with the screen off.-Home and navigation buttons are too small. I find myself having to press one of them several times before it registers the action.Update 9/23/2017:Phone will no longer connect to WiFi unless I reset my router first. Even with the most recent wireless update. This is a major concern considering what I paid for this device.Update 3/17/18:Phone is almost completely useless now. The charging port is broken or loosened. I can no longer use the device while charging. The slightest movement disconnects the charger.

The phone was great initially, very good performance for the price. Camera was decent. However, after I updated to Android 7.0, it started having multiple problems. First the microphone stopped working, I got it fixed by turning off Google voice assistant. However, it still has a ghost-touch issue where the phone keeps exiting from apps or switches between apps without user input.

Lots of space to store things & with a 16g SD card I still have over 2/3 of storage left (I have a lot of songs, movies, apps) other than the phone now falling apart with no reason & no response from Blu it was a good phone.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","June 13, 2017",3.0,Not bad but not great either,"Ok, I have had this phone for a few months now and I like it but dont love it. Nice screen size, the resolution doesnt bother me in the slightest. My issues are all evolved around mem and cpu.  Get into any intensive graphics and you get a lot of slow down. Its not really a gaming phone.Now here are the issues I have on a constant basis. Apps closing for no reason. You go into them, and before you can do anything the app may just shut down on you. try again and this time it works. This behavior happens with several apps and games.The latest update which came out a week or so ago introduced Ads into the remote control app which is stock with the phone and I didnt even use it but boom, all kinds of ads coming up every day. Had to disable the app (you cant uninstall it) and uninstall the apps update in order to get rid of the ads. Come on, who wants ads on their phone? Blue help app has also started throwing up some ads as well. You are already using lesser hardware to make the phone cheap, do we really need ads added? Come on BLU, get your act together on this. I took away a full star for adding these ads into the default apps that come on the phone.Other random issues. You get a news update, if it sets there for more than say 20 minutes and you finally tap on it to read it, it opens the opera browser, goes to the article and displays a blank page. If you open up another tab you can see the first tab populated but as soon as you go back to it, its blank again. If you read the news alerts right away, they work perfectly fine and display like they are supposed to.There are lots of little software glitches like this on this phone. It can be very annoying at times. If you just need a phone with a few apps to get you by, I would recommend this phone. If you want to make this phone your primary internet device, stay far away from it. Just way to glitchy and to slow. Im not sorry I bought it, I needed a tide me over till the note 8 comes out and this is working for me despite the issues."

After six days of use, I can honestly say that this phone takes the punishment and keeps performing like a soldier. I already dropped this phone on accident (during a hand-off to my son) on concrete and thanks to the silicone case that came with this phone by default, there are no visible scratches or nicks and the phone's functionality has not suffered one bit. I've always been partial to Android OS and have not been disappointed since I made the switch from the Apple iOS to Android. It came with a screen protector on the phone already yet it came with a second one as a replacement. It also came with a silicone case, head-buds that sounds really good, fast charger and a beautiful box to stuff all these accessories in it. For $149.00 I got a hell of a bargain. I didn't have to purchase additional accessories like you would with other new phone purchases. I have people asking me about this phone consistently as it looks very pleasing to the eye. I didn't get this phone as a fashion statement, I got it because of the strong functionality that it kicks out. I'm not sure why other consumers have claimed they have had negative experiences (maybe because they are the competition) and they see this phone as a threat to their bottom line. Either way, if all you care about is a solid phone that does what you want it to do, that functions as smoothly as it looks....I advise you get it!"

Not their fault.","I loved it but I had to return it because I had Net10 and used Verizon through them. If --- in the last three months or so -- your service has gone from good (or great) to cruddy on Net10, you need to be aware that (according to the customer service rep I spoke to for 2.5 hours about the problem)  the Verizon folks ""upgraded"" their tower equipment to CDMA and this is a GSM phone that would no longer work with the closest tower. It did reach out beyond the closest and sometimes get me service, but it was patchy and unreliable. IF the tower had remained GSM this phone would have been a real winner for me. I loved it. But, due to the service provider's change, it didn't work out for me. I wish it had. I wound up with an iPhone 5s and I prefer this one. BLU, however, (I also spoke to them about their phones)  doesn't have any CDMA phones, unfortunately. I told them to fix that."

For that reason, I can't recommend it.  Blu phones are rebranded from Gionee in China. The spyware is installed as a system app, which was discovered by running the Malwarebytes program and confirmed as such by other Android security sites.  So far this phone has been impossible to root.  I have ways to disable spyware but it's not something the average person knows how to do or is even aware of. Amazon should not be selling this phone until the issue is resolved."

Frustrating as the phone is the same one my son has had for almost a year now and his has worked perfectly the entire time he's owned it.  It's why I chose this model Blu.  Returned it to Amazon who as usual are the absolute best to buy from with their no hassle returns and instant refunds.

I've since contacted the company and left a voice message and I have not received a return call. So sadly to say I had to order me a new phone,  no it is not a blu product. I would never purchase another blu phone. The body of the phone looks nice but the apps and the services and it is not worth having this phone. I'll go on YouTube or open up an app and it would just shut me out and go back to my home screen. The other thing that it does is that her freezes and you have to power off and power on and then the phone response and what you were trying to do that's not right so as a result of all of this this will be my last blu phone ever. Don't purchase it. Also went through a major update on Saturday the phone updated all of our phones and that only made matters worse my alarm clock doesn't work the way it was my phone I have it set to automatically shut off and come on it set the time up to what it wanted to, all of the beautiful colors are gone out of it like in my contacts each person's name was in a different color circle and it would have liked their initial of their first name and I thought that was really cool now it's just a gray and white and just looks dreary and just I'm not pleased with the update or the phone. Do not purchase this phone if you wanted more than one year because I've had a less than that all three of us and all of them are gone they're terrible."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 16, 2017",3.0,Great Smartphone at a Great Price!,"I've had this phone since the release date. So far I absolutely love the Vivo XL2! Out of the box I installed my ATT sim card and SD card, powered it up, transferred my apps and contacts from my old phone and I was ready to go. It loads apps quickly and much more efficiently than my old LG G3.The battery life is fantastic. Again, my old phone was good for six hours before it needed a charge (15% battery remaining), and that was with the screen dimmed and minimal usage. With moderate use and decent screen intensity I can go for 10-12 hours before it gets to 20%.The camera is decent although lacking in some features, such as panoramic view and slow motion video. But for the price I'm willing to overlook it. Picture quality is better than most phones were just a few short years ago.For my purposes there are two shortfalls with this phone. First, there is no Near Field Communication, so Android Pay is a no go. I was big on Android Pay with my old device, so it was an adjustment going to this phone. Second is the availability of cases. With the exception of the flimsy rubber case included, there are no cases available for this phone. I hope this situation takes care of itself soon.Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase.Update:Shortly after my review the phone started giving me serious issues with the touchscreen. For no reason the phone will roll back through all the previous screens in the app being used until it goes into the home screen edit mode. If you hit the home button Google comes up then the phone returns to the edit mode. Only way to get out of this state is to shut the phone off and on. Returned it to Blu (it was out of my possession for a month!) and it still gives me issues. I emailed them and they want me to do a hard reboot again, which didn't work in the past.To their credit Blu did replace it with a new phone."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","September 16, 2017",3.0,"I love this phone, but I hate the charging issues","I totally love this phone. I've been rocking it for a good 6-7 months at this point. It would be the perfect phone for me if it wasn't for issues with charging. I've looked into it but it seems like this is a pretty common problem for this phone. The charging port is not working correctly and is getting worse and worse. I'm not rough on my phone so I feel like this shouldn't be an issue. It also sometimes does this thing where the battery life will suddenly dive and the numbers on the charge will tick down in seconds. With that problem, it sounded more like a software issue rather than the battery, but I'm not 100% sure. The battery life overall seems to be poor compared to where it used to be. If wireless charging were supported that would be cool.Other than those issues I really do love this phone. The screen size, the speed, and the functionality of the phone is awesome. Looks like I might have to dig through warranty things and see if it can be fixed."

Each time I did what they told me to do, I had to hang up and call back into the queue. After doing this about 4 or 5 times, they finally told me to send the phone in. They said it would take 20 days to fix (IF they decide to fix it). I send it in, and they tell me there's something wrong with the calibration. They then go on to tell me ""the only way this could happen is if you drooped the phone, so we won't be covering it under warranty"". I know for a FACT that I never dropped this phone.

As you can read on the specs of it, yes, the hardware and software on it is pretty cool for the price. But lots of things it CAN'T do. Such as:1) You cannot have different ringtones for different things. You can have a ringtone for calls, and then a tone for ""Notifications"". ""Notifications"" means email, text, and notification. Facebook fortunately has it's own tone built into their app, but I cannot set different tones for email or text message. So a single sound goes off and I don't know if it's an email or text message. NO WAY to change this!2) It comes with several built in apps that you cannot delete, and I bought mine unlocked.3) There is a TINY ""key"" that comes with the phone that opens the slot for SIM or SD cards. If you lose that, it'll be difficult to get into your phone.4) Speaking of SIM and SD cards, if you put an SD card in, you cannot use the dual SIM option.5) There is no built-in calendar. I had to download an app to display my Google calendar as a monthly calendar on one screen.6) It CONSTANTLY asks permission for every single app! And if you say yes, it still wants to take you to your settings and tells you to remove the ""Overwrite apps"" option....I do and it just resets a lot of times and keeps asking me?!? I've never had a phone ask for permissions to draw over other apps on every single app almost every single time! It's really annoying!This phone is quickly becoming not worth the cheap price. It works okay, but has lots of annoying little quirks that you have to download other apps to fix or just deal with. And the whole reason I bought this phone was for the storage capability."

I do however experience some lag here and there when I try to switch the rear cam to the front facing cam. A reboot fixed that, but I'm concerned it will do that again and I'm not so happy to reboot every time that happens. I don't use the camera much, but I just wanted to let everyone know about that issue. The default android on it is a bit plain so I suggest you put Nova Launcher on it to make it more personalized. I like that it comes with a case, a screen protector already on it so you don't have to worry about putting it on yourself and an extra screen protector with earphones and the charging cord. Overall, its a good phone to buy if you are just coming in to android or if you can't afford a higher end phone."

I have had two Blu phones, first one did not have LTE for Cricket (At&t Co), this one does and I have brought it up North (Canada) and had 4G coverage with more than decent speeds. So far it DOES recognize 128gb micro SD cards, but be warned mines REQUIRED formatting (back up your data!!) The call quality is very good. Also supports Bluetooth connection (currently have my Bluetooth headphones connected, no issues). Also has Limited LED notification. I'm giving 5 starts not because it is a perfect phone (by no means it is), I'm giving it 5 stars for everything it delivers for the money your paying (bang for your buck)Camera - your back camera will look like your front (selfie) camera... Which is not really a good thing considering the back is supposed to have a higher megapixel count. Pictures get degraded once you zoom in. The Video by Contrast is actually VERY good and sharp (not sure why still photos don't mirror this)Battery - pretty solid. While it won't get you by a whole day of heavy usage without charging (youtube, Netflix, Google maps .....Amazon etc...), You will find that with heavy usage your phone will not Drain as quickly as you might expect and holds up pretty well. For an avg user (texting, occasional video) a day or more will suffice. Bonus: I have not experienced the back getting hot during heavy usage or accessing my rather extensive media content on my DAD card.Memory - As mentioned above, it recognized (after formatting) my 128gb SD. The Added 32 internal GB (use primarily for apps and updates) comes in handy and allows for you to obtain apps and app updates with out causing your phone to slow down from clutter. The 3gb ram also is Very Good for this.Ui - Blu's Ui and ......added ware is not really an issue and I sectionalized all of their icons to the last screen. Though I will mention their initial access screen (prior to lock screen) does have it's moments in accessing your camera or home page quickly...........yeh it has its momentsSpeaker - At best, the speaker is not the best. Do not be in a busy room and expect your peers to hear the sound on a video your showing with clarity.Leftouts - for those that care about these features, unfortunately the phone lacks the following:- Removable battery- Finger print scanner- Heart rate monitorSummary:For $149 this phone delivers what you need AND what you want and then some. It is an economic phone that brings near flagship quality to the table. You won't get everything, but you will get a lot for your money. While falling short of Apple or Samsung Expectations, you really could not ask for a better [Economic] phone.*Paid Full price with my own money*No promotion or sample given"

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","February 25, 2017",5.0,"Beware of ""Ghost apps""!","I waited a couple of weeks after purchasing my BLU Vivo XL2 to write this review, so I could use it for a while before reviewing it. I love this phone! The screen is large and my videos and photos appear crystal clear and vivid. It took very little time to get my phone up and running: after I figured out how to insert my SIM card and my SD card, I was able to load all my contacts and my apps. Installation of everything was fast and easy.My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy 5, and after just paying it off, the external speaker died. My husband's Galaxy 5 quit before mine did, so neither of us was happy about that or willing to replace it with the newest, $700 version. After doing research and reading reviews of all the options on Amazon, I decided to give this BLU phone a chance. From my experience with it so far, I can say that the BLU Vivo XL2 is the best phone you're ever going to get for such a low price. Honestly, I see no difference between my BLU phone and the Samsung I had before, and in fact the screen on my BLU is bigger, making it feel like a nice upgrade.I use my phone for the typical purposes: taking photos, reading email, texting, surfing the net, listening to music, and downloading documents to read and edit them. I am an educator, not a business person, so that may make a difference in my cell phone needs. Anyone who believes that the only good phones are made by Apple or Samsung, and who think you get that much ""more"" for the additional $500 or $600 will probably find things to complain about; but coming from the Galaxy 5 to this phone, I can easily say BLU has it beat.I was not a big fan of the app layout: the BLU doesn't come with an app drawer where you can put the apps you don't use often. But you can just download Nova Launcher, set up your home screen and apps the way you like, and you're all set.My only regret about this phone is that I didn't purchase it the week before, when there was a $99 flash sale. At the $149 I paid for this excellent phone, I got a great deal. At $99, it would be a steal!A recommendation: When you buy the phone, get the insurance plan. At $25 for 2 years, it's well worth it. It covers for water damage, broken screen, battery malfunction...all the common damages. I've dropped my phone a couple of times and so far, so good. But for the extra $25, it's worth it to know my phone will be replaced if I damage it.UPDATE (February 20, 2018):After having the phone for less than a year, and returning it twice for replacement and repair, I have decided to give up on it. It's unfortunate, since the phone could be great for the price. But the constant glitching, the ""ghost apps"" opening and closing on their own, is driving me crazy. BLU accepted the phone for repair under warranty, but the customer service was bad: no one ever contacted me to explain what was wrong with the phone; they shipped it back without any information regarding what they did to repair it. And the phone is still glitching. I ordered a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone and once it arrives I'm parting ways with this BLU phone!"

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","October 19, 2017",1.0,"Yes, I fell for it, but you don't have to...","Price seemed right, so I guess I took a shot... I assume many of you will read this and all the other reviews, good and bad, then do the same,  hoping you will be the lucky one.  It's sort of like a $160 lottery.  My advice: pay a few extra dollars, get a Samsung or some real brand and be finished with it.  I had a Samsung for a few years, was as good as new (I'm not into upgrading phones all the time, just not that important to me)... but my carrier (T-Mob) upgraded its network and I HAD to switch.  Checked everything, and the Blu seemed to have the basic features and speed I need.  Watched the video with some pseudo-geek opening the box and blathering about all kinds of statistics. Fine, I'm sold.The phone seemed to work fine at first, had to get used to the UI, which is never fun, but after a couple of weeks I had it figured out.  Reloaded my apps and seemed to be in good shape.  Nothing startling about the performance, the ""long battery life & fast charging"" didn't come true true but I really didn't care; I'm usually in a car and charge overnight so that is not a big issue with me (btw you can't change the battery).So here I am, just a couple of days shy of 3 months and out of the blue (no pun intended) the phone just stopped charging.  No drops, shocks, voltage spikes, etc etc. - just pfft - and it doesn't charge.  Unplug and re-plug and it starts to charge for like 30 seconds then stops; 3 different charges, 3 different cables, yeah, its the phone.  Go to my Amazon account and there is no ""return"" option for this device, slightly getting that sinking feeling... contacted the manufacturer.  After the customary overseas call-center ""thank you for that information"" (stop saying that!) and ""Yes I understand sir"" conversation, the result is I have to mail the phone to them and they will repair or replace with a new phone... in *10 to 15 days*.  Now, I don't know about you, but I simply cannot go for 15 days without my phone; I use it to conduct my business; waiting for 15 days is not an option.  Of course, I tried reasoning with the ""manager"" - you've been there - who repeated the exact same ""we can only follow our standard return procedure"" answer to every futile attempt I made to speed up the process. (Please, lady, at least say it slightly differently each time, try and make it sound like you're actually listening.)So I'm going to send in my phone and hope I'm the 9 day guy and not the 15 day guy (talk about lowering expectations) and have to make the decision if I double down on this disaster... Do I go and buy a REAL phone, or buy a flip-phone or some cheap alternative to fill the gap and keep as a backup for the next time -  and there WILL be a next time - I have to send the phone back?  Probably going with the REAL phone, because eventually this phone will be out of whatever warranty is covering me for this serviceSo, undoubtedly many of you who have read this far are still going to roll the dice - like I did.  But it has always been true and always will be: you get what you pay for.Good luck!"

Initially, it worked just fine. Running fairly smooth and could handle every app I needed. But more recently, especially in the last month, it has had a tendency to glitch out.

Then it wont even take another input leaving my with a brick showing my home screen. before, merely locking the phone, waiting a moment, and trying again would work to regain usability after a couple tries, but now it will persist to have this issue after up to an hour of fighting it.

But, the phone is only $150. What could I expect for a $150 ""smartphone"". On my phone, the Bluetooth chip must not be a very good chip. My Bluetooth turns off at any given time, I have to manually turn it back on and sometimes turns back off. I turn it back on, the phone turns it back off.

This may help someone if you're having audio issues after the update to 7.0,"This is the second time I have purchased this phone due to it being lost. I liked the first one so much that I purchased it again.Now for the real reason for this review: After the update yesterday to 7.0 I lost all call audio. I couldn't hear anything anyone said when making or receiving calls. This condition also effected blue tooth calling and the speaker phone feature. After a reset the device began working again so I loaded the usual apps and set it up the way I normally would and then it started acting up again. I then reset it again and paid attention to the issue after each application install and every change I had made to it. I figured out that the problem only occurred when I had the voice activated ""OK Google"" feature activated. So if you're having this issue deactivate the voice activated ""OK Google"" feature.Google account/settings/voice/voice match, and turn off: Say ""Ok Google"" any time.I hope this helps someone out and keeps them from pulling their hair out trying to figure out what's going on."

I loved that phone and have used blu for about 3 years now. I am having issues with this phone and I have literally had it in my hand for less than a month. I ordered it on 9/1/2017 and took it out of the package on 9/5/2017. It takes about 8-10 hours to fully charge which is the absolute worst feature about it. When I read the specs I expected it to do as it said it would and charge fully within 2.5 hours. The camera is also very shakey. You must keep your hand absolutely still for a few seconds before the image is fully taken on the device or it comes out blurry. The charging issue needs to be resolved.UPDATE:I have had this phone since September 2017, today is Feb 6th 2018. The phone is constantly freezing and it won't hold a charge longer than a few hours. Unfortunately you cannot replace the battery either. Still having charging issues except now in 8- 10 hours the phone only charges between 20-65% these phones definitely aren't built like they used to be. I dont recommend this phone."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 21, 2018",2.0,Disappointing,"I've been a BLU customer for a while now, and decided to take the plunge with the Vivo XL2. Usually when I buy BLU, I'll find a happy medium of the lowest price combined with the most features available, and get away with a new phone for under $90. This time I decided to spend the few extra dollars, and get something that I had hoped would be a really nice phone, and not just a bare-minimum to get me through another year.  At first, I was really happy with the phone. The touch screen response time an app load times were short and crisp, the screen is bright and large, and overall, when the phone works, it does work really well.However, I didn't even get the chance to drop the phone a couple of times before it started developing a personality. Ever since I first got the phone, it has had a weird quirk where when I'm making a phone call, I can only hear the person on the other end about 20% of the time or less. There isn't any consistency as to when it happens, it's really just hit or miss. Again, I still have yet to actually drop my phone (and I have the BLU-version of an OtterBox case on this phone for when I do) so this issue isn't because of anything I have done since receiving the phone. It has the same problem after connecting/disconnecting Bluetooth headsets; however I've noticed that I'm more likely to hear the call if I use a Bluetooth headset than if I use the handset earpiece.Also, the battery life on this phone is rather disappointing. I wouldn't even bother mentioning it, but BLU felt that it was a selling point and brought up the ""huge"" battery this phone had in the ad on Amazon. All in all the battery works as you would expect, but don't expect to be going multiple days without having to charge up.Overall, I'm surprised that I've had less problems with the BLU phones that cost half as much as this one.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","May 14, 2017",2.0,9 Months of Daily Use: The Trip Report,"Multitasking has yet to present an issue and this phone has comfortably handled everything I've thrown at it. Even comes with some nice value-added stuff I wasn't expecting (pre-installed screen protector, TPU case, earbuds, IR blaster). Some marks against it:-Don't really care for the UI or a lot of the on-board apps; many of these are installed at the system level and can't even be disabled, either. Stock Android is fine and I sincerely don't understand why manufacturers have such a stick up their ass about actually sticking to it; BLU could definitely do much better here.-This phone will take decent photos under most circumstances, but trying to take panoramic photos on this thing is an almost Sisyphean task at times; ANYTHING that forces the camera to re-focus will totally break the photo and you'll have to start from scratch.-Nine months into use in December, this phone has started to develop a nasty habit of ""ghost-pressing"" the back button a bunch on its own and completely unprompted, kicking you out of apps and vibrating incessantly all the while. I've apparently been lucky with mine, as this has been an oft-reported issue at least since July. I'm not sure what causes it, but considering I've never dropped this phone or exposed it to any extreme conditions, this can't speak favorably to its build quality.-I don't know if it's the included earbuds or the headphone jack, but it is notoriously difficult to consistently get this phone to pump audio through the earbuds; audio often cuts out, pipes out of the phone speakers at an obnoxious volume, etc.This phone was a steal at the time of purchase, but now I understand why, and I don't totally feel comfortable recommending it for daily use. Look elsewhere unless you just can't find something else with comparable hardware at this price point."

And I think I can actually give a decent insightful review.I have a friend who has the Samsung Galaxy S7edge, and he likes my blu Vivo xl 2 better. I have not performed a speed test but in everyday use my phone accomplishes every task I throw at it. I am a very heavy user, I'm on my phone for most of the day. So far I am very pleased with the phone. I just got a update to the Google assistant..... Yea. I will never pay for a Carrier branded smartphone again. I use T-Mobile as my phone service provider and the signal strength is excellent. The only thing I have missed about my T-Mobile flagship phone is WiFi calling, so I downloaded Google hangout as a alternative to the T-Mobile baked in version, not quite as good but acceptable. I have used the cameras on this phone a lot, in different lighting and subjects and I find the performance to be quite good. I think that a lot of the quality of the photos taken has to do with the photographers ability. The pictures my friend gets on his S7edge are not as good as the ones I have taken with my Blu vivo xl2.All in all I like this phone very much.I have uploaded more pictures for your review.I will add to this review at a later date.I mainly wanted to illustrate the capability of the main camera. The photo I am including in this review is a picture of our little dog Kiki on a bad  hair day..... lol 😁This was taken in poor lighting with a moving subject. All editing has been accomplished with the camera software that came preloaded."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","June 12, 2017",5.0,Five Stars,No problems nor issues
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 7, 2017",3.0,"Yes, but not for the NON-tech-savvy","After just three days I am very pleased with the BLU Vivo XL2. But it took a bit to get to this place: out of the box I hated the custom interface -- I agree with those who described it as ""heavy"". Fortunately I read the Amazon reviewers who recommended replacing it with Nova Launcher, which I did, and then customized it to my liking. Now it is a beauty.The major issue has been using an SD card. I wanted this BLU for my media: audiobooks, podcasts, epubs, video and some music. I have been using Android since 2.3. Never have I had so much trouble working with an SD card. First, there are no instructions (anywhere that I could find) for working with SD cards. This is the first phone I have had with a SIM/SD drawer. There are two slots (of different sizes) in the drawer. Thank goodness another reviewer alerted me to placing the SD card in  SIM slot #1. This may seem dumb, but I was not careful when I popped the drawer out and did not notice the orientation. So when I placed SIM and SD card in the drawer the first time I had the phone display side up. This was a big mistake: when I pushed the drawer in it stuck. Obviously the wrong side, and I had to use tweezers to pry the drawer out, which was not easy. Why was this not in the quick start guide? -- to re-insert the SIM/SD drawer, the phone MUST BE DISPLAY SIDE DOWN.Secondly, since there is no information about how to use the SD card with this model I did what I have done with the Androids I have owned in the last decade or so: I allowed the Android system to format the card to its liking. After formatting, the file explorers in the Android OS or my PC (using USB cable) did not recognize the card -- no trace of it. I do not recall all of the steps I took to fix the problem (I suspected the card was not mounted, a problem I have not had with Android), but before I did I contacted BLU customer service. Other than the lack of information about using an SD card on this machine, the dull-witted BLU CS is the other reason the Vivo XL2 gets 3/5. I explained the problem to them as I have here; their response had nothing to do with this phone. I fixed the issue on my own and now my SD card is recognized and loaded with my content.For whatever reason, BLU loves the paint on this machine (the battery cover). I expected to be wowed, but no: it looks better on the computer photos. I now wish I bought the gold rather than the midnight blue.I cannot tell that the battery charges any faster than the Galaxy S3s and S4 I have used for years, but the description claimed some sort of quick charge. The battery does not seem special.BLU includes a (relatively hard) case in the package, which is nice. I usually prefer more rubbery silicone, but this one allows the phone to slip in and out of the pocket easily Unfortunately, it does not protrude over the screen and protect it. Also, the corners slip off the phone easily. I may prefer the gummy case I had for another phone, which fits better than the one made for it (the slots do not match).During baseball season I watch each of my team's games on my phone. I have not had a chance yet on this one, nor have i watched high quality video yet. But at this point I am quite pleased with the screen. I love the 5.5 inch size.I thought I might like having the power and volume on the same side of the phone, but so far I do not because it is more difficult to pick the phone up without pressing the power button.I read some reviewers comment that BLU phones do not last. Right now I am happy with the Vivo XL2, but I want it to last for years rather than a year.I would recommend it, but I worry about folks who are not tech-savvy using this phone."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","October 4, 2017",4.0,"Won't Razzle-Dazzle, but a Good, Solid Smartphone and a Great Value","I've had my Vivo XL2 for two months now. So far, everything working about how I expected.My wife and I have had several Blu phones in the past. 2 of the 3 were fantastic (my Studio 6 and my wife's Energy 2), one was a bit of a dog (my Studio 5+5).So far I've been happy with my XL2. It's clearly not a top-of-the-line smartphone, but it's more than enough for what I use it for---phone and texting, taking photo snapshots, watching the occasional Netflix or Amazon Prime video, and Kindle. There's nothing particularly great about it that makes it stand out, but everything is solid---decent looking screen, responsiveness and speed, accurate touch for onscreen interactions. My main gripe with the Blu Studio 5+5 was that the on-screen touch detection was BEYOND AWFUL; I'm happy to report that the Vivo XL2 does not have this problem at all, touch detection is very good.Probably the worst part of the phone is the battery life. It's merely average; I can go a couple of days of minimal use before needing to charge it. So, nothing all that bad, but nothing to brag about either.All in all, this is an incredibly solid smartphone for a very good price, and is easily all the ""smartphone"" non-gamers would need. It's not the sexiest thing out there, but I've been highly satisfied with my purchase."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","January 28, 2017",4.0,BLU VIVO XL 2 vs ZTE ZMAX 2,"So this seems like the first real review from someone who actually owns the phone.Just got it in the mail yesterday. This was suppose to be the Gionee P7 Max rebranded by BLU. The back isn't as shiny as Gionee so looks like BLU did a good job recasting it with their logo. This seems a lot heavier than my previous smartphone (ZTE Zmax 2) but I needed an upgrade from my 16gb internal storage and 2gb ram. VIVO XL 2 offers 32gb internal storage and 3gb ram but it definitely doesn't feel any faster than the Zmax 2. In fact, in some cases, it feels like it lags behind Zmax 2 when I only have one or two apps opened. Which I found it to be strange.Even though their width and height are quite similar (VIVO XL 2 being slightly wider), I found the Zmax 2 and its buttons a lot easier to hold and use with one or both hands. For some reason the VIVO XL 2 seems like it's almost jabbing the side of my palm when being held. I don't find it comfortable and the buttons on it are rather slimer than the Zmax 2 and while you would think that might be a plus, taking screenshots (holding lower volume+power button) and volume control is somewhat of an unnecessary hassle.Also the back finish on Zmax 2 really helps you secure having a grip on your phone whereas it's easier for VIVO XL 2 to slip in between your fingers and fall.The login screen that asks for your pattern or password for VIVO XL 2 is awkwardly place towards the top of your screen (whereas Zmax 2 place it at the bottom of your screen) - which makes it difficult to unlock it with just one hand.One good thing about VIVO XL 2 is its 13MP / 8 MP camera. While it's nothing extraordinary, it does seem to take clearer picture than the Zmax 2. The VIVO XL 2 also comes with Android Marshmallow, whereas Zmax 2 is upgradeable to that, it's installed with Lollipop.As for the accessories, all of them are WHITE. Which is a key giveaway BLU was too lazy to source their accessories to match their phone colors (since VIVO XL 2 only comes in blue and gold). It's a USB charger so it does take longer to charge your phone back up in compare to Zmax 2. Package wise, it was a lot nicer than what I expected for a phone in this price range. The phone built is pretty much what you would expect in this price range but from afar, it doesn't look cheap (if you purchased the blue version).BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a 32gb internal storage and 3gb of RAM with decent camera on a budget, VIVO XL 2 might be for you. If you already have a phone with 2gb of RAM, that +1gb of RAM isn't going to give you any fairytale endings."

Why would I buy another Blu phone when this one is annoying me with spam. Blu would have a better chance of selling me another one if they didn't make me regret getting this one. Mine didn't come with the ""super special"" sunburst back that Blu touts so hard for this phone or the box I've seen in unboxing reviews. Made me wonder if its real. The phone has more native memory than the Advance 5.0 it replaced and that's all I wanted anyway. I found it responds better without the screen protector. Other than that it's just a phone.

The phone would act like the home button was pressed (and sometimes held so that the Google Assistant would be enabled). You wouldn't be able to do anything else on the screen until this glitch stopped. You also couldn't press any of the other buttons on the front. I would have to shut off the screen, wait a moment and then go back to what I was doing on the phone.I contacted Blu, who had me send it in at my expense, and then they ""fixed"" it (they wouldn't tell me what they did to the phone). Now, two months after that, the phone started exhibiting the same issues again. My wife has the same phone, purchased just a few months after I initially bought this one, and hers is working fine.Outside of this issue, they phone works great. Plenty of storage for apps, music, etc. Great amount of RAM for apps to run and not be sluggish. Speaker volume on pretty much any BLU phone is always low, so wasn't surprised that this phone was the same."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","October 20, 2017",3.0,... bought my Blu VivoXL2 in March and it worked great! Loved the extra memory for the price,"I bought my Blu VivoXL2 in March and it worked great! Loved the extra memory for the price. 6 months down the road, my apps started freezing then the battery went crazy from 80% to 30% in a matter of seconds, then it wouldn't charge. I called Blu and I had to send them my cell and pay for the shipping. Luckily I saved my previous cell otherwise I'd be without a phone. I mailed it on a Friday, they received it on the following Wednesday and they shipped it back 2 days later and I received it on Tuesday 7 business days later. Not bad. The phone arrived with no invoice or what they fixed. No email either explaining other than they shipped my cell back to me. I called and was told they changed out the battery. 11 days later again the battery won't charge now. So as I write this review I'm getting ready to call them again. Save your money and buy a Samsung. My Samsung prime is still kicking after a few years. It just didn't have enough memory. Update- so I just called Blu customer service. Told them my cell won't charge or turn on after trying 3 different chargers which included the Blu charger that came with the phone originally. So now they put in a request to replace my cell. They are emailing me a return label so I don't have to pay shipping again, which I appreciate. They will be sending me a new cell not a refurbished one per the csr. So I'm satisfied so far."

The function of it is a bit different than any Samsung or LG phone that I've had so it takes some getting used to.I've had it for over 2 months now, and about half my calls are going straight to voicemail. At first all my calls were going straight to voicemail.I use MetroPCS. And I have tried troubleshooting by service carrier and also by hardware manufacturer.No one seems to be able to help me permanently resolve this issue. BLU will warranty it,  but in order to do that I will need to mail my phone to them first, which leaves me without a phone for up to 15 days which to me is not acceptable.I'll have continue to try to troubleshoot is or buy another phone. And I think the latter would be a better option.But I don't believe I'll be going BLU again."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","May 9, 2017",3.0,"Good Device, but...","First of all, let me just start off by saying this is a really nice phone. The design is great, although very prone to fingerprint smudges. DO NOT GET FOOLED BY THE 3GB of RAM. You only get to use abut 1-2. When I have received 3GB RAM devices outside of BLU, 2.96-2.85 GB of RAM was available for the user to use. Horrible memory management on this phone, but it actually still runs smoothly. Also, this phone is missing quite a few important LTE bands, so it's not fully LTE although you will get good speeds in some places. Overall, I'd say this phone has a pretty elegant design, feels great in the hand, screen quality is spot on and nice, etc. Nothing other than RAM and LTE coverage to complain about. Improve those two and this is honestly one of the best devices I've used. Outside of the RAM, there is no difference between this and an iPhone 6+ (that's noticeable). Camera quality... I've seen better for the price or but it's still pretty good in good lighting!"

Looks great, wasn't sluggish at all. But a couple of months in and my touchscreen glitches to the point where this is unusable. I'd be using my phone and the touchscreen will rapidly start pressing buttons I didn't touch. Shutting it off and turning it back on doesn't solve the issue and it has only increased in frequency. The only thing I can do is put the phone down and let it run its course until I can start using it again."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","February 22, 2017",4.0,"My favorite so far, BUT........","Sooo,  This would be my most favorite Blu phone(out of 5) ever, got it on a lightning  deal for 99.00, but.....There is an issue with notification/ringtones not giving a sample sound when you select one.  To test it you have to have someone call or text you.  Blu would not acknowledge this in 3 complaints through amazon so I started a return and received a second phone, same problem, and returned that one.  4th time they said there is a software problem and they are working on it.I have had an issue with my call blocker app not functioning properly.My advise is whenever buying a phone for 100-150 expect some glitches.  For the money I think they are great. My Life XL functions great but it only has 16gb memory.  This phone has a great 32gb and accepted my 64gb sd card no problem  Fantastic.  If I can get this problem fixed, I would keep this phone for a long time.  If this problem does not get fixed, I will return this one, and go back to the life XL.I also previously complained on the lock screen  and lack of an app button to show all your apps of a previous model. That was not answered, but have found with this model it is their ""carefree"" launcher.  I switched to Nova launcher and am happy with that."

How?!,"UPDATE: I had to return the original because it kept freezing and refusing to turn on and randomly restarting.  Now I have the replacement and it's doing the same thing!!!!!  I think there may some issue with the firmware when a smartwatch is connected over Bluetooth and a WiFi network is connected.  If you disable any of those things the phone works fine.  Beware those of you who intend to connect a smartwatch.Nobody needs to spend $400-$800 on a smartphone any more.  This is a NO COMPROMISE $150 phone.  Show me someone who needs more features and power than this phone has and I will show you a darn liar.  Not only does it have a terrific 5.5"" size screen with a curvature to the gorilla glass 3, but it has an IR blaster to control your home A/V system, great 4G and Wifi radios with crystal clear audio on both ends, and the battery lasts and lasts! Looks and feels like an expensive phone too.  Amazing value and it's American made too?  What more could you possibly ask for.  Great stuff BLU keep up the good work.  If Nougat gets rolled out on it, I might just soil myself."

It was a big step up from what I had been using (tracfone models) and I planned on keeping it for a good while.  Well, I managed to break the camera lens and figured I'd order another- guess what, Amazon won't sell you two of the promo phones.  I looked at the various Blu offerings and settled on the Vivo XL2.  Maybe I'm just easy to please, but I love this thing.  32 GB, great camera, and what I think is the sweet spot on phone size- not too small, not too big.  Great display, and they throw in a case. 2 screen protectors (one already on) and a good quality set of earbuds.  I took the advice of another reviewer and put a 128 GB sd card in and it works fine.  I guess the only complaint is the ""dual"" sim card aspect.  It's not a dual if you want to use an sd card, it will only accept one."

The build quality is very good and the casing has a substantial feel to it.

One very impressive thing I must say is that my reception using this phone is greatly improved at work where nobody gets service - With this phone I have decent service from ATT.

I the fact the phone came with a screen putector and case was awsome. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a budget friendly option that wants all the features of name brand Android but not the price tag of one. I saw a review of how uncomfortable it was for them to hold in hand but that's truly false. I have rather small hands and its comfortable for me.

Very slick but I previously owned the Blu Vivo XL and just expected a lot more.  The biggest improvement is in the backing.  The old version was cheap plastic and broke easily.  This model was definitely stronger.  What I didn't like is that it says the speed of charging is improved and I found it incredibly slow.  If not using the Blu branded charger, it literally didn't fully charge when left plugged in overnight.  With the Blu charger it took 3 hours.  Hugely disappointed considering that was a big selling point.  There is also some software that is not removable that kept coming up as malware.  You couldn't even disable it.  I'm big on security and this scared me a bit.  Finally it was quite a bit slower than the old model in my experience.  I will be returning today."

This one has never allowed me to change the original texting ringtone.  Occasionally the regular phone ringtone will turn into an actual telephone type ringtone.

I put all of my apps on it and I still have a ton of space. Also, it is thin and sleek.  I love the gold color. I wish it had more case options. It is so new (released Jan 2017) that there aren't many (none) cases available.  But, that does not matter. The phone itself is great.  It came with chargers, a case (not a big deal case, but it is good for now), screen protector, earbuds, connector cord for other media.  It is great.  The phone is fast. The camera's are great.  I am just very pleased.UPDATE:  Although I am still very pleased with the phone itself, I am disappointed with the lack of accessories. The case that was provided with the phone was not substantial enough.  I contacted BLU customer service about phone cases; I was was told that I needed to contact BluPhoneParts.com; however, when I called them, they said that they do not provide cases nor are they affiliated with the company.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 19, 2017",1.0,This smartphone is a disappointment,"UPDATED REVIEW:After seven months of having this phone, the battery ended bulding up and completely breaking the phone.The battery life was not the best ever since I brought it, but after about four months of use it started to go straight downhill in its performance eventhought I always used the charger that came with it.Long story short: Ended up with a bulged up battery that cannot be replaced because it is non-removable and thus, with a useless phone.I deeply regret this purchase.OLD REVIEW:I purchased this item a little more than a month ago. Before it, I used to own the original Vivo XL (item that I absolutely loved, its performance almost flawless during the whole year I owned it -just had a little problem with the app Snapchat- But it had a great value for its price) that I sadly ended up breaking in an accident.While looking for replacement I found out, to my huge excitement that the VIVO XL2 had been released just a moth before, and to the same price than its predecessor. I was torn, trying to decide which one to acquire but, considering the great item the VIVO XL proved to be and after checking out this phone's specs, I did not hesitate and chose this one, expecting an upgrade from my previous one.However, this cellphone proved me terribly wrong. It fails on many aspects the original did not.•Its screen in incredibly sensitive, to the extent that it reacts even the touch of the earphone's wire -it's not a nice thing to be listening to music or watching a video and having it closed or changed by your own earphones-.•Both cameras are absolutely bad, they claim them to be of 8 and 13MP just like in the original, and yet their performance is by far worst even if made to snaps pics in their supposed best quality. The primary one keeps blurring out the photos and, when it does not they seem granulated and rough, lacking color and brightness. The secondary one only takes decent pictures when outside under direct sunlight, if the photo is snapped indoors -where lighting is usually a bit lesser- they turn out blurred and undefined. Problems I did NOT have with the VIVO XL which photographies were clear and vivid (a little too sharp while in the camera screen, maybe, but nothing too dramatic).•The apps continuously freeze and crash.•But, by far, the BATTERY LIFE is absolutely the worst this Smartphone has to offer compared to the original one. While I could have my VIVO XL running continuously -with a normal app use- for almost two days straight after a single charge, this one does not last more than maybe 12 hours, when I'm being careful not to open too many apps. Such is the bad performance it has in this department that many times, the minute after -literally- the battery level reaches 15% the counter will go down incredibly fast and the cellphone will shut down. Such thing only happened to me with a very bad performing Samsung I used to have some years ago, because yes, you guessed it, this did NOT happen to my original VIVO XL which I many times kept ""alive"" for hours with less than 8% because it had an OUTSTANDING performance. This is not an exaggeration.Also, less points to this model because the battery is not removable, which leaves you unable to forcefully turn it off if it eventually freezes -thing that I'm sure will happen to me at some point soon due to this device poor performance-.So, in resume, if you are planning to buy this item I HIGHLY recommend you reconsider it and purchase the original VIVO XL instead. That Smartphone is by far much better than this supposed upgrade.I ended up regretting greatly having bought this one alternatively, because I ended up getting me a very disappointing downgrade. I have nothing good to say about his cellphone because it practically did not improve its performance compared to the previous one."

It has been about 3 months, then I found there are some problems:1) It spent the battery quickly even though I didn't use it that much. I have another Samsung Galaxy S6 as my primary one.2) The operation system isnot stable. Sometime It lost contact I don't know why .3) I bought previously 3 BLU Smartphones from Amazon.com, all cheaper ones, and it all working smoothly without any problem.4) I am not happy with this BLU VIVO XL2.I hope that Amazon.com can accept my Return or Exchange another Smartphone."

I used it a few moments last night after a full charge, then put it to sleep. Now there is about 30% of battery life left. I used my Honor 5x for a much more extended amount of time last night, then put it to rest, too. At this moment, it still has an 80% charge.I thought 3g RAM and 32g Memory would mean a faster device. Not so. My Honor (2g Ram/16g Memory) matches every inch of speed.The sound on calls is very ""tinny"". Ringtone and notification alerts are muted so that you can not hear them if you're more than 10 or 20 feet away from the phone. Very little sound comes out of the device.Ultimately, if you want a device that makes your hands uncomfortable, has no battery life, isn't any speedier than lower rank smartphones and has no volume, this is the phone for you.AMAZON!

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 27, 2017",4.0,"Good phone, good price, but no battery life","This phone has been a pretty easy phone to set up.  I still haven't gotten a memory card to work with it, but no more than I've used it so far it has sufficient memory.  I did have to but an adapter for the SIM card because mine was a micro mini.  Another reviewer highly suggested putting your SIM In second slot and memory card in the first.  Also I've had a terrible time getting it to carry through on calls in my car using bluetooth.  But a call to their help center suggested a hard reset and that fixed the problem.  I'm only giving for stars because the battery life is not the greatest and I don't know why they advertise it as a fast charge.  To get to full charge has taken an average of 3 hours!!  Over all for the price it's a nice phone and it comes with a case, head phones and a charger.  I'm not impressed with the case at all but have found reasonably priced ones on Amazon.Update:  I've had this phone for 4 months now.  It's plugged in more than it's  on my person!!  I've checked into getting the battery replaced but no one in my area carries the battery out can do it.  It takes an extremely long time to charge and a very short time to die."

Before ordering, I was concerned about the screen resolution, but once it arrived and I started using it, I should say that paying more for a phone with a greater screen pixel count would be waste of money (at least for myself, as would not notice any difference). The screen resolution of this phone is just fine. Brightness is ok also, with no difficulty to read the screen when outdoors. The build quality of the phone looks good. Battery life is better than all the previous phones I had. I always charge it overnight, but it could go on for two days without charging (my previous Nexus 5 - the one from LG - wouldn't last until the evening). Sound quality is also better than expected. Speed is not great, but is more than satisfactory for everyday use. Also nice is the fact that it comes out of the box with a screen protector already fitted (plus a spare one in the box) and a nice protective silicone case. The only things I miss is an NFC reader. And the camera could be improved (focus is poor if you are shooting in low light conditions or close to the object). All the rest is just fine!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","January 27, 2017",5.0,"Wow, nice job Blu.","Received my Vivo XL2 earlier today.  Even though I just received it, I do have a few comments.  The unit itself is well done.  It looks much better than in the pictures.  One thing I've noticed with this phone and with my Vivo 4G LTE is that the screen stays cleaner than any other phone I've owned.  Presently I have a Nexus 6 and as good as it is, I'm constantly wiping the screen.  With the Vivo's, the screens repel smudges and prints extremely well.  The back isn't a fingerpring magnet either.  Yes, it gets prints on it but not near as bad as other phones that I've had.  Because of this and that I like the appearance so well, I've decided not to use the case on it.  I also ran the Vivo XL2 and Nexus 6 side by side and went through some apps (Google news, Radar Express, Weather) and in each case the speed was identical with both.On a negative note, I wish Blu would be specific in their information as to Sim size needed.  I couldn't find anything confirming that Sim 1 is a Nano Sim.  So I ordered a Nano to Micro Sadapter which I didn't need.  Sim 1 is a Nano sim card.Update 1-28-17  I needed to the permission requests before the ringtones would be made available.  I initially tapped deny but when I re-did it and tapped ok it gave me the build in ringtones.I did change the launcher to Google Now.  I mention that because with either launcher there are no ring tones except one in settings.  Can someone Confirm this for me and if this is the case, what is a good app to use for ringtones ??

Even for the full price it's not a bad deal for what you getSpecs - Very decent specs for what you pay for.  32 GB of storage space should be standard on most phones these days.ConsBeing nitpicky I'll name a few cons in the interest of being balance but these aren't major complaints I have but just complaints I can imagine people having.Screen - Not the resolution, the fact that it has a dark bezel around the perimeter of the screen inside the bezel so the screen doesn't extend right to the end of the bezel like with other higher end devices. Not sure if this is a design flaw or purposely made choice to keep price downCamera - Ok taking regular pics but don't expect ANYTHING like what you would get in higher end phones but then again for 99.99 I did not expect Iphone quality.UI Overlay - Blu should stick with making cheap phones and leave the UI building for higher end manufacturers like Samsung and others. Look at how long Samsung and HTC took before people took to their UI systems.  It's not a bad UI it's just not needed.Overall the phone is a real treat and I guess time will tell the full story on how long it lasts if it's treated properly.

The Gorilla Glass 3 on this Vivo XL2 did not seem to help at all. Maybe the glass is just too wide to be so thin. Combine this with the fact that you cannot find a case for this phone yet (the one that comes with it is thin and useless) and you can't buy parts (except from the manufacturer who charges too much to justify repair)... and you would be wise to look elsewhere.

Outside of that it still works great, I use it as a tablet/MP3 Player now.  But anyway... this model Vivo XL2 works very well. Pretty much identical to the orig XL except it went back to the Micro USB jack instead of the USB-C jack like the XL has. One of the two SIM slots doubles as a micro-sd slot if you want extra storage. (Guess they had a location issue on the motherboard, which I find odd since they didn't have that problem with the XL)  They moved the camera to the top middle, added more on-board storage, and a little faster processor, and a IR blaster for using your phone as a TV remote.  The camera is a little better, and the sound quality is about the same as the XL model. The interface changed a bit too.. once I figured out how to turn off BLU's or Android's funky smart screen then it worked perfect for me. I like it.. I just hope it lasts for years and years..like five at least.  I never had a phone break down before five years before. Maybe because before I found the BLU phone I was dedicated to Samsung user.  But then Samsung started coming out with yukkie phones after the S4.  BLU makes some nice phones. They are getting there..Stylish and functional.  Especially the dual sim feature.

Many want a mobile that responds fast, and I tell you the Blu vivo XL 2 does just that, thanks to the 3gig RAM. The picture is sharp and the camera's got some nice features. Though some space out of the 32gig internal memory have been taken by applications, but there's still enough storage available for files-including videos, so if you are the type like me, that uses both SIM slots then you might not be bothered about an external SD card. One SIM slot is MICRO and the other is NANO, however you can only use one SIM slot if you intend on inserting an external SD card. Battery strength is 3150mAh, would have better if it were 5000mAh to help sustain the much needed apps on the phone. Comes with nice useful apps that helps you get updated. The head phone sound is clear, doesn't echo. Video resolution is crystal clear, nice to watch 🏠 of Cards😉. All in all it's a phone I'll recommend any day. A trial will convince you!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 22, 2017",5.0,Stop searching and just buy it! ;),"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!! this phone. It is everything I wanted, and more. I was hesitant at first, with it not being a ""name brand"" phone. I previously had a Droid turbo 2 with Verizon, but after having a couple of financial hardships I had to switch to a pay as you go plan. I didn't want to lose the luxury of my phone but I couldn't afford a high end Motorola. After reading all of the specs of this phone I decided I would take a chance, and I was not let down! I'm not one to write reviews but I believed that with this purchase I had to. This phone is AMAZING! the screen quality is excellent.  I love the smart gestures it reminds me of my Droid or a high end Samsung phone. It has a 32 gig internal memory and if that isn't enough then you can add a SD card for extra space, unlike my Droid or a newer Samsung phone. The function to connect to my TV is very handy. I haven't had a television remote in about two years, and I couldn't download an app to connect to it because I can't connect my tv to WiFi. I tried it believing whole heartily that it wouldn't work, and was extatic when it did. These are just a few of the many features that I love about this phone, and I fully believe it is just as high end as any Motorola or Samsung phone and for only a fourth of the cost. At this price YOU CAN NOT BEAT IT! stop searching and just purchase it! ;)"

The phone will not send text messages to be read  via the connection to the Bluetooth in my car.  This is a safety feature that I used frequently in my line of work.  If there is an upgrade to add this feature that would make this phone a GREAT device. If not, is there a different phone manufactured by BLU that has this capability?"

The 32 gb is more than enough storage but I added another 32 gb just in case I need it. Comes with a screen protector already on it and an extra protector for when you need to change it. It also comes with a rubber back case. I can do without all of the extra apps and wish manufacturers would stop forcing this stuff on us consumers. There is no way to uninstall the ones I don't want and some of them you can't even disable them. Other then that this is a great phone, I would highly recommend this phone as a great alternative to those expensive phones"

Great camera that satisfied me a lot with all the different options which me is great. The charging was fast, but what comes with fast charging also Comes with fast battery loss. The resolution of the phone is also great, but only a bit of lag, but not hard to deal with. I had very little problems. I wish I kept it safe if I didn't get it soaking wet. I loved the phone overall and will be buying it again. I love Vivo and for me being a teenager, I do use the phone very often And I'm surprised it didn't break down on me with my amount of use on it. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it does get very slippery because it is sleek and the steps to get to the home screen as well as watching videos using the phone's video viewing app which does show poorly. I do highly recommend though!"

I bought this to replace the R1HD and so far it is better on all levels as it should be.  The battery has lasted 24 hours with moderate use and still has over 50% left.  The OS doesn't exhibit any lag (yet) switching or running apps.  It does contain a compass sensor that allows you to use some navigation or star apps.  As with my experience with BLU phones, the camera is borderline terrible in all but bright sunlight.  The lock screen overlay is unusual but you can disable it if you choose.  The case it comes with is pretty lightweight and definitely won't protect it well with any falls onto hard surfaces.  I hope they make a more substantial case as an accessory.  The included screen protector also scratches very easily, but at least it comes with one.Bottom line, this is a solid midrange phone with a poor camera that doesn't break the bank.  The phones are cheap enough that you don't mind upgrading when next year's model comes out."

Has some neat features and tons of space. The battery lasts fairly long on heavy usage. Takes nice photos and apps open very quickly. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is just some personal views preferences like the back doesn't come off which could be a problem down the road if I ever need to fix my phone. There's no app folder. All apps are on your screen. You can create folders to put your apps into but that'll remain on your screen so I can't hide any apps. Lastly this isn't a fault of the phone but this phone is very new and not really a major company so if you want a new phone case or screen protector you'll be very limited.Tldr: good phone overall. Neat features. Some personal preferences it does not fill for me. This is worth your money though."

I love everything about this company.But, not even a week after I bought this phone the charging port for THIS phone started acting up. No joke.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","March 26, 2017",3.0,It's just kinda ok.,"There are a couple of issues with the phone that keep me from loving it. First and most obvious is the grip of the phone or the lack thereof. It is slippery...terribly slippery. Yes, it includes a hideous semi-clear silicone case but case options are minimal at best. Secondly the screen responsiveness could be better. I tend to miss type more on this phone than any other phone I've had and I often hit the wrong numbers when dialing. Another gripe is the lack of support for 5ghz wifi connection. Why? Just why? Other than that it's like every other Android with similar specs. Pretty good camera, fast enough, and fairly reliable."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","June 16, 2017",1.0,Slowest phone I've ever used,"My advice to all, please don't buy this phone. I purchased this phone right when it came out and have been using it for about 5 months now. The only thing that it has going for it is that it looks good. It's slow, apps launch without me touching them, the screen resolution is terrible, and for some reason the flashlight turns on randomly even though the screen is locked. I previously used a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge and bought this because it was cheap. I now know why the flagship phones are so expensive, you really do get what you pay for."

I really like the big battery on it.  The screen is great too at 720p so this will draw on battery less.  SD card and LTE support for TMobile a big plus.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","October 4, 2017",1.0,Great phone....while the month lasted,"I bought this phone month end July 2017...started using it August 10th. Bought it because of glowing reviews seen on Amazon.When I got it, I loved it! The phone was just like the people said. Loved the design, the graphics, storage space, though I hated the front camera (my blu life 8 was better).....Until last week (the week of September month end), I realise the phone will not charge. I decided to try charging it while off, it charged. After a couple days, the phone went blank and totally responsive. Felt it vibrate when I said 'ok google'...but otherwise dead phone.After googling my problem, I realised there were maaaannnnyyy reviews of persons having the same problem with the phone! Contacted the manufacturer as advised. The only option, return the phone to them for them to repair and return to me.  Told me the phone would need servicing! I live outside the US, it costs $$$ to send it back from where I am and I was also supposed to secure shipping to have it return to me! The length of time this would take equates to forever. I don't see why I should stand these costs only after having a 'brand new' phone for only a month and some weeks! No, sah! Blu could care less!This is my second Blu phone, the first lasted three years but after this, I'm done! Buy at your own risk."

Overall, it seems like it is good quality for the price.This phone has several good points. It has a lot of memory storage for the price which I really like. I like keeping language learning apps on mny phone and always had a problem running out of memory on old phones. That has not been the case with this phone. I like the appearance of the phone and the screen is pretty clear. It also came with a free frosted case which was a nice bonus.The cons to this phone are the very quiet speakers and a tendency to freeze up. The freezing hasn't been a huge issue so far, and I'm not sure whether it's caused by bugs in the apps I use or the phone itself. However, the speakers are the quietest I've had on any phone."

Well right off the bat I didn't like the launcher that it was loaded with. I turned that setting off after I finally found it. It is a beautiful phone but what's the point if you have to have a cover... and on this phone you HAVE to have a cover. Because of the shape and surface of it, it's like trying to hold onto a wet bar of soap. Lastly after using it for a couple months with no issues I notice some of my files just seem to disappear (pictures most noticeably) from time to time. I would not recommend this phone although I could understand why some people really like it, it's just not for me.Update 7.28.17..liking it less and less, in fact of the  three BLU phones I have (this one being the most exspesive of the three) I rarely use this one. Problems with Bluetooth compatibility. I rent cars regularly and most of the time my Vivo will pair with any car but while it allows me to stream audio, the phone function does not connect so, I can't make and receive calls through the vehicle system. I've tried several fixes but always the same results. I can not recommend this phone and I should have sold it when it was a newer modwl but my conscience wouldn't allow me to inflict it on some poor unsuspecting soul."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","June 25, 2017",5.0,Great but why sacrifice the color,"Great phone got all the specs a moderate techy needs. Speaking as someone who went from the xl to this one though; the xl2 color sharpness is noticably weaker. I think it's a result of the much thicker Gorilla Glass which is too bad for me cause I don't need this Glass. The xl screen never scratched, even when in a pocket with my keys. It was also shatter resistant enough to go from car seat to concrete a handful of times with no damage so this thicker Glass seems unnecessary at least for my purposes. The colors by no means dull just a little weaker than the xl."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","November 18, 2017",1.0,"Good stats, nice phone, but RMA and customer service nightmare","This one looked really promising.  I'd purchased it as an upgrade for the Energy X Plus, which I absolutely loved.  However within one week of opening the box, the screen started going crazy.  I tried performing soft resets, hard resets, and factory reboots, even removing my SDCard from it.  None of this worked.  I contacted BLU's support team several times in a row and kept getting canned responses back (several days later) with instructions on performing a hard reset--which I already explained (in excruciating detail in the third time) that I had done.I was finally told that I might be eligible for an RMA.  The instructions for the RMA would require me sending the phone back to them at my expense, and that basically I would have to go without a phone for several weeks while they decided if it was a hardware issue or not--and that the replacement (or my original phone) would be sent back at my expense.  Part of my work involves doing RMAs routinely, and it's standard procedure with every vendor I deal with to send the replacement along with a waybill to send the original back, then to bill the customer for the difference if the issue appears to be customer-caused or the original unit is not received.  So this is shifting the cost of doing business off to the consumer instead of the company.  I'm glad of the price cut on these versus other companies, and I totally get there are trade-offs, but this one's just a bit steep for me.  I wouldn't mind paying a bit more if it meant having a phone that I can actually use and customer service interested in making sure that I can use what I buy from them.Look, I've had good success with Blu over the past few years, and I'm not meaning to dog them over this.  I've been a huge fan since the dual-sim capabilities let me carry both my work and personal phones in one package, which is a huge convenience.  But my experiences with this phone have really left a bad taste in my mouth after seeing what happens when the phone doesn't work, and I just don't think this is one that they'll recover from easily."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","October 31, 2017",1.0,"BUYER BEWARE - BLU Products has a VERY, VERY bad warranty policy that you should consider before buying their products.","BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!Any ""physical damage"" to the phone - including superficial chips and scratches that do to affect product performance - WILL VOID THE WARRANTY.I purchased this phone on March 1st, 2017.  The phone worked well, and I like that it came with a free case and screen protector.  Up until, the phone fell out of my pocket and hit the ground.  The case fell off and the plastic edge of the phone suffered a minor chip.  The screen was not damaged and the phone worked perfectly fine afterward, so I decided to keep the phone and buy a better case for it.Fast forward to September 2017 - seven months after the chip occurred.  The phone starts acting weird - registering ""ghost touches"" - backing out of applications while I am using them.  So I emailed BLU customer support and they sent me instructions on how to do a hard reset.  I followed their instructions and performed the hard reset but the problem continued.  Next I called BLU customer support.  When I spoke to a representative, I was asked ""did the phone suffer and water damage or physical damage?""  I explained what had happened, the phone dropped, the case fell off, and the phone got a small chip in its case...  The CS rep told me that if the phone was subjected to ""any physical damage"" that the warranty was void.  I reassured them that the screen problem had nothing to do with the chip in the case - that the phone work perfectly for seven moths after the chip.  The CS rep instructed me to send a picture of the phone and a copy of my receipt so they could take a look.I took two photos of the phone - the first was a close up showing that the damage was just in the plastic case and the second was an overall shot showing how insignificant the chip was and what good condition the phone was in (see attached photos).  Needless to say, when I called back BLU Products denied my warranty claim citing ""physical damage"" to the phone.So I'm out $150 because BLU's case failed to protect the phone and I wasn't smart enough to return it to Amazon the minute it got chipped. (Again the case was defective.).So, please don't make the mistake I did.  Consider that if your phone get's so much as a scratch on it, BLU Products can deny any warranty claim regardless of if the scratch or chip has anything to do with the damage.Too bad.  I really liked the phone.  But the warranty policy is terrible."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","April 5, 2018",3.0,An okay phone that's not really worth buying at the end of the day...,"The phone is an ""OK"" product overall. The build of the phone is nice where it feels good in the hand and not too heavy to handle or difficult to engage comfortably. The screen resolution is probably one of the most pleasing offerings for a phone in the below $200 price range. Now to the bad parts. Although the phone has some positives it's the software and apps that really anchors down the score for me. When I first updated the software it functioned normally without much issue in the first day but after the second day everything collapsed pretty quickly. First, whenever I opened up an app it would take long to buffer and sometimes it would freeze and cancel. Other times, the apps would work for a good 15 mins and then it would slow down incredibly such as gaming apps for example. There were times when I would try to close an app like LinkedIN for example and the master 'back' button on the bottom of the touch screen would take 3 times until it finally backs out; that shouldn't happen. Speaker quality was okay, the sound didn't project loud enough for me and it was on one side of the phone which lacked the surround effect you would expect. Last, I would have issues receiving calls where it would redirect them to my voicemail without ringing my phone. And on top of that, I couldn't clearly hear the person when speaking to them which is like a basic essential for any phone. So overall, the phone is okay for the price but as they say you get what you pay for. Just look for other brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and Alcatel which are known to have good reviews."

This was a gift for my husband so I was originally happy with the additional accessories that was included with the phone, I was pleased I would not have to buy a case or screen protector until the phone screen shattered after the first drop. I carefully compared this phone to others and read the reviews and ratings. I also read in the details of the phone by the manufacture that the screen was made of gorilla glass, and that it was durable. That detail had to be false because after one drop from a couch to a hardwood floor should have not shattered the screen. I believe a case with a little lip on it could have prevented this accident.

This is the same resolution as the iPhone which came out in 2010 (7 years ago). You will really see this in games and media viewing and it will be a constant reminder that you own a sub par phone.4) The screen will scratch with your fingernail, get a protector immediately.What I do like about BLU phones is that they are lighter than most phones, both physically and software wise, although there will be some miscommunication in settings due to grammatical errors and poor word choice. It charges fast, the os is clean, the buttons off screen are a blessing, and generous amount of memory keep it running fast for a very long time.In essence, it gets the job done, it just doesn't do it well.

I dont know what happened with my 1 day shipping but I am furious. Along with this I made a previous purchase of the Blu Pure XL last summer and a little after three months of having it the phone would no longer charge I even went out of my way to buy new chargers and still it would not charge. I then contacted a few phone repair companies to see what they could do because I couldn't send the phone back due to it being past the 90 day period. So I called these repair companies hoping they could help since I had actually liked the phone but every single time I got a response of ""We don't repair Blu Phones"" or  ""We are unable to operate on that brand"". Now some people out there reading this review may think that I'm overreacting but I beg to differ quite honestly. Now what I have yet to mention is the phone I got right after the Blu Pure XL, which was the Blu Life One X2 first off I have to say this product started off proving to me that as crazy as it may sound Android Phones do in fact break. After receiving the product I accidentally dropped it on my carpeted floor in my college dorm. Now most people may be thinking your just clumsy but sure that may have been what I was at that moment but do you realized how astonished I was when I saw my screen cracked all over from landing on carpet. I dont know what it is with BLU right now but for me its not looking good I'll be back on here later to comment on whether or not I receive my package in the mail but unless my experiences with BLU improves I won't be recommending or buying anymore of their products especially if they cannot be repaired."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","February 2, 2017",1.0,Dead Phone After a Week,"When I first received the phone, there was an inconsistent delay of when it would wake from when I pushed the power button (about 10 seconds).  It didn't happen frequently so I didn't think too much of it.  Then the phone started to randomly restart.  Usually, it would restart when the phone was sitting idle on a table.  The restarts became more frequent so I just ordered a replacement.  Though, today, the phone is now completely dead.  No indicator lights when plugged in and holding down the power button.We'll see if the replacement phone fares any better.UPDATE:The replacement exhibited the same issues as the first one but the issues have become less frequent the more I use it.  Very strange.  Hopefully, it lasts a decent amount of time.  At $100, it's a good deal as long as you can live with the random quirks but at $150, there are better phones out there."

Bluetooth doesn't work properly in the car which is a important thing.Badly works in the car I always have to restart the car to get the voice connect to car. WhatsApp audio doesn't work good.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM","January 25, 2017",1.0,Really bad camera focusing,"Let me save you some grief. I have three Blu phones, one being the Vivo XL (previous version). They are a lot of phone for the money, but every one has flaws and customer service is non-existent. The big flaw with this series is the totally useless camera. Most of my pictures turn out blurry. Focusing was very slow and seldom worded. Worst camera I've ever had in a cell phone and I've mostly just stopped using it. I almost bought this update, hoping this was fixed. Well, google this phone and read the review at android guys: ""Action shots routinely came out blurry and the action was generally missed by a slower-than-optimal shutter when using HDR mode. The HDR mode was almost a must as pictures regularly came out under exposed in low-light situations. Decently lit scenes led to shots suitable for social media uploading, but not much else.""So if a decent camera is a must for you, stay away from this phone."

"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",12-Jul-17,1,Camera sound won't turn off!!!,"This is the second time we have attempted to order this phone and both times the camera shutter sound won't turn off! I have tried amazon technical support and although helpful and nice they couldn't solve the problem.  Turns out some countries don't allow phones to turn off their camera sound, meaning we got a phone that was meant for another country.  Returning again and trying eBay!"
"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",6-Feb-18,3,battery,"It works, and it's clean. Professional packaging and it arrived fast.Downside, the battery must have not been replaced because it won't even last half a day idle. Good thing is that at least this isn't a waterproof phone and I can easily buy a battery replacement kit for less than $30 on Amazon. It really would've been great if they put new battery so it won't suffer on performance due to shit iOS's ""get a new phone or your old phone will be slow"" tactic aka BATTERY GATE. I figured I would run into a problem like this since it's a refurbished one anyway. It's impossible to know the performance and battery life without activating the phone. I bet a lot of people have this problem but who would actually return it once it's activated? But hey, I'm not paying a thousand for a new phone and I bought an iPhone knowing there's an ongoing battery gate controversy so I'll just suck it up and won't even bother sending a complaint.But, I chose to give it 3 stars since the price wasn't bad, it seems easy enough to replace battery, and it doesn't cost that much to buy a battery kit.  I don't ""like"" it, but it's okay."

"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",27-Jun-17,1,Screen Responsive Half the Time,"We were excited to receive this refurbished phone --- it appeared to be in great shape (like new) and easy to get set up. After a few uses the screen began to be unresponsive from time to time.  We have turned the phone on and off several times and the problem has continued and is now occurring with greater frequency. The screen is now unresponsive about 50% of the time. remains inactive The home button, volume controls and off button still work and the phone responds to them, so we know the phone is still working, but the screen just isn't responding. Tried it with the screen protector on and off, and the outcome is the same. Really disappointed in this transaction and would request an exchange or refund."

"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",7-Mar-18,3,Test Your Phone Fully/Siri Cant Heat Me...,"When i received this item it was in perfect shape with no scratches or defects; to the naked eye at least. After about a week, i realized that Siri couldn't hear me unless connected to headphone/bluetooth device. Thought this could be a software issue, because the iOS for the X had just come out and I didn't drop the phone or get it wet. All that being said, i still gave the benefit of the doubt to the seller for running all the necessary test to be ""certified refurbished"" . Then last week i took Apple up on its 29$ battery exchange program and told them about the Siri problem i was having and they took a look at it. They ran some test and said my front mic (aka Siris ear) wasn't working and that it was a hardware issue and that they often can go out with regular use. This isn't a huge problem for me as i dont use Siri that much (especially now), but i know a lot of customers who would and be very upset by this. Just be sure to fully test your phone, and be sure not to let the window pass for returns/exchanges.  2.5 Stars."

Not happy with this purchase at all. You'd think since its refurbished, they would fix this damn problem too. Returning it and will give it one last shot before I just get my money back, get a new phone, and never use this company again. THEY SUCK."
"Apple iPhone 6 Unlocked Smartphone, 16 GB (Gold) ",17-Jan-17,1,Rip OFF. I am so disappointed!!,"So I have to revisit because I think that this purchase was tantamount to a RIP OFF. I previously reviewed that phone worked well and that's because I hardly used. I had it as a back up just in case my galaxy edge powers down. Recently my galaxy broke and I tried to use this iphone and I can barely swipe the screen to unlock.  The phone has never fallen and it's still in the state in which I purchased it. If I were to do it again, I would never buy a refurbished phone. I'm just soooooooooooooooooooo mad.Works beautifully. Few scratches here and there and dirt in side groove when received but overall very good.d."

I kept thinking how cool it was that I bought this normally so expensive phone for such a good price. I soon found out this phone is terrible: The screen freezes, the screen's sensitivity is awful (sometimes it opens apps I haven't even touched or types on its own) and the screen is so hit-or-miss that I had to get rid of my password entirely because there were several instances where I could not get into my phone. I would press the 1 button and it would type 0 or 7 and would put random numbers in until it actually disabled itself. Having had this experience, I now understand why more people don't buy refurbished cell phones. While it seems really cool to have the latest technology at a discounted price, I think full price is worth having a fully functioning device. While I am keeping the phone (because I am unable to return it!!) , I am very unsatisfied and I will not be buying a refurbished phone (especially not from this seller) again.If I could give this a 0-star rating I definitely would. I am so frustrated with this phone and cannot believe I spent so much money on it."

I think that more time should be placed on warranty for devices such as this because after I started having issues where it was constantly shutting down I wrote them to see if I could have it exchanged or pay more to trade for a 6pl or 7 they basically told me the time had pass and the sale was final and nothing else could be done to assist me.Even if you don’t see fit to assist me based of time or whatever I really thought it could have been handled better.. the customer service level is very poor and didn’t really appreciate how my situation was handled and to date I’m still having issues with the phone but this is just my lesson learnt...

Dead after 9 months.  Battery is dead and nothing will make it go. Tried all the online 'iphone not responding stuff'.  Tried the hard reboot, reset, etc.  Cleaned the charging port (it isn't dirty and doesn't look damaged).  So, looks like we'll roll the dice on a battery swap and pray it's not money down the drain.

The phone comes in many varietys of colors, and the Apple company is frequently ugrading the style of the phone.Concerns:One of my concerns with the iphone itself is that it is very skinny and can cause the iphone to crack easily if not taken care of properly. If I were you, I would buy a Lifeproof case to prevent the phone from cracking. If the phone cracks, I would bring it to a company so the crack doesn’t grow bigger and ruin your phone entirely. This product is like an ipad but you can text and call on it.Positives:The iphone is an apropriate size that can fit in your hand, and it also has a large screen. The camera on the phone can take good quality pictures and videos, leaving you with a fantastic picture. Also the iphone has an excellent battery life, and it can last up to one to two days without needing to be charged. I can use my phone often throughout the day lasting me all day. I prefer people who are older than 10 should have an iphone. The iphone 6 is a great phone. I use this product everyday with no problems. It is a high qualitly phone with many beautys that makes my life a lot easier. If I were you, I would go buy the iphone 6 asap."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 6, 2016",1.0,Manufacturer Defect,"The Galaxy S7 was wonderful while it worked. Great screen, great battery life, decent software, amazing camera, MicroSD slot. Everything you'd want in a phone. The waterproof claim is also impressive, although I was never bold enough to test it. I put the phone in a rugged UAG case and babied it, hoping to get a few years out of it.However, six months after purchasing, the screen suddenly began to die. Half the screen is now dead despite there being no physical damage or trauma to the phone. I babied this thing, seriously. No drops, no scratches, no cracks, nothing. I suspect a manufacture defect with the screen's connector or something. First, I called Samsung. They refuse to repair international versions of the Galaxy S7, even if you offer to pay for the repair. Then, I called the seller about getting this repaired or RMA'd. They didn't respond. I contacted Amazon and they also contacted the seller. No response. I called the seller, no one picked up the phone and the voice mail box was full. Spend the extra cash and get this from a different seller. I'm out a lot of money for a faulty phone.For more information about this defect google ""vertical lines in screen,"" - it seems fairly common and most people have a similar story."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 27, 2016",1.0,False advertising,The description on this phone said Dual Sim and it wasn't.  I tried putting in a second SIM after buying one and was told the phone was for a single SIM.  That is false marketing.  I want myou money back or a DUAL Sim phone

Started going through it and it didn't have most of the features a s7 has. Took it to a phone place only to be told it was a fake. The serial number was fake everything was fake. Had it confirmed by another it was indeed a fake s7. Returned same day then they wanted me to pay return postage on a free shipping item. Nope. Then didn't refund the entire amount I paid. Then tried to return the money on an Amazon gift card! Nope! 2 weeks later and countless calls finally have returned complete. 100% fake phone!

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 17, 2017",1.0,"Nice at first, then problems, now dead at 10 months","I bought this from seller ""The Wireless Circle"". I am a US AT&T customer in a 4G LTE market.First off, the phone came with the UK electrical outlet Fast Charger with an outlet adapter to US. This wasn't a problem to me other than bulkiness just not what I expected.Another thing, in the central midwest, I had a hard time being anywhere where I received good signal strength 4G LTE. I even called AT&T about it and attempted a new SIM card (thinking that possibly the card unlocked certain frequency bands). I ordinarily wouldn't care about this, except the battery statistics constantly say that the cell standby was using most of the battery.This weekend is when the real problem started. I was using the phone and when I looked back after a few seconds, the screen was frozen. I tried to end software but everything was unresponsive--the touch screen and the buttons. I tried restarting the phone: the power button produced no response. With older models, I would remove the battery at this point in time. In the last 2 days, I have tried charging, performing various button press combinations, and even taking the device to an AT&T authorized retailer. This phone is dead. 10 months at about $550.I would not recommend buying this phone unless you have a solid plan for returns/repairs/warranties."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 11, 2018",3.0,it is a very cool phone! it is sturdy,I am more of a Nexus / PIxel User! I bought this phone for my mother! And to be honest! I could have bought a Pixel for the same price! And i would be having less issues! (with issues i mean my mother asking me stuff about samsung apps that don't do anything helpfull) Everything in this phone OS has been modified by Samsung! if you ask me the Samsung layer is completely over rated! Everything is trying to go over the basic android functions but with a Samsung App! That means you have a ton of apps that you can't remove because they are part of the Samsung layer! And you could do exactly the same with the Native andoid tools/apps using less memory!But don't take my word for it! it is a very cool phone! it is sturdy! well made! but again! i bought this one for my Mother! i would never bought this phone for me! i am planing to change my actual NExus 6 phone for a Pixel 2!

Lost my first phone.My second just stopped working after year. Never been dropped or wet. Had it in a folding case. Purchase from another seller.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 29, 2017",5.0,Samsung galaxy done right,Absolutely in love with my Samsung galaxy s7. The phone lasts for a long time compared to most phones and it fits comfortably on one hand. This is similar to the iphones such as the fingerprint unlocking is pressed down like the iphones. Also to get the sim card and the SD card out you need a pin just like the iphones. The SD card allows the phone to hold more space than the 32GB that is included in the phone. Also this phone is pretty slim unlike my former Samsung Note 4.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 5, 2018",5.0,Still a great phone!,"An awesome phone and considering the age and the price it definitely holds up to any modern smartphone, not surprising because it's only two and a half years old. But it's upgradeable to the current Android software and comes with all the features you would expect. Love the water resistance especially coming from a phone that had no water resistance. My only complaint is sometimes switching to Bluetooth to phone and headphones causes a glitch where the sound well only come out of the phone speaker and not the main speaker, however this only happens rarely and usually a restart will fix it. Overall I love this phone probably be best phone I've ever had, would definitely recommend if you need a good smartphone and want to have a little cheaper price:)"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 13, 2016",4.0,Good Hardware Design with Bloatware.,"The hardware of this phone is reaaaaaaally decent but the software is not, I really dislike the bloatware Samsung put into the phone. My previous phone is Nexus 5, I pretty like the Google apps. There is something called Package disabler on Google Play store, non-free but only $0.99. I spent an afternoon disable the pre-installed applications and installed Google apps. It turns out very good.I don't like the screen color BTW, seems too saturated to me.I ordered a black color, but it came with Champagne color, seems good to me, and I'll keep it."

BAD IDEA. As soon as this happened, my phone began to restart. CONTINUOUSLY. OVER NIGHT. I went online to research and most users of the S7 suggest to do a factory reset. I emailed amazon.com and they directed me to a Samsung Customer Service website. I inquired about the damage and they gave me a step by step run through a factory reset. I made sure the battery was full. It was restarting so often that I could not even back up any of my data. I LOST EVERYTHING. I did the reset and it was okay for a few minutes. Just enough time to let me sign into my google account and proceed. It kept restarting. Overnight. I decided to do it one last time so I charged it. Glad I checked back on it after an hour because the device was HOT. I could not even hold it long enough to unplug the charger from the wall. I am just out of luck with this phone. I don't even know what to do or how to get it replaced. I understand the no warranty but what happens to customers like me who took damn good care of their expensive phone and only after a security patch update that the phone started to act up and never returning?!Has anyone had this issue?

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 5, 2016",5.0,Great purchase! I originally had a U,"Great purchase! I originally had a U.S. Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930AZDAATT) on the AT&T network and when I got it wet, my cell phone insurance plan directed me to go ahead and buy a new phone.  Since the retail versions sold at AT&T stores would have run me $695 + tax, I decided to look at the international versions because they typically are a bit cheaper than the full retail versions in the states. Glad I went with this one.  After doing some research (which can be a pain to do) I found out that this SM-G930F cover almost all the same bands/radio frequencies that the U.S. AT&T uses.  I get great coverage for data, and about the same or slightly worse coverage for voice, but since I rely on data mostly, I am not complaining.  The phone actually seems to be a bit faster than my original S7 from AT&T, because it does not come loaded with as much bloatware (theres still some from Samsung, but not nearly as much as the U.S. carrier versions of the phone).  Also, the setup and activation was very easy.  It comes with the same nano-Sim card and micro-SD card tray (both fit on the tray and it slides into a port on the top of the phone) and after you pop in your carrier's nano-Sim card, it recognizes the nano-Sim and automatically connects.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase.  If I run into hardware or connectivity issues, I will post back here with an update. If there are no updates from me within the next month, then assume everything works well on the U.S. AT&T network (metro ATL location) using this international Galaxy S7."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 20, 2016",5.0,Why would you ever lease a phone??,"So, I am going to skip the review of the actual phone because that's been done and the previous reviews are good enough.Seller: From this seller on Amazon, mine came as the UK version with a UK plug. You'll have to go in and change some settings if you don't want your currency in GB Pounds and Google Maps in a British Accent. Well, I kept it because it's a good conversation starter.  These guys even went the extra mile and sent me an adaptor for the fast charger. Lukly, I had a U.S Fast Charger but, again, a good conversation starter.Network: I'm living in the US and on the AT&T (GSM) network, and it works perfect.Comments: My only concern moving on is if the S7's battery does get recalled, how is that going to work in the US with a UK warranty and Serial Number. Other than that, I wouldn't worry about anything from this seller. I would 10/10 buy again from these guys.Overall: Beats LEASING a phone from AT&T for $200 more than the international list price. I don't understand why one wouldn't go this route."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 31, 2016",4.0,Great phone!,"I will be starting off with good points of the phone,-3000 mAh battery: This is great due to most phones nowadays not having such large batteries, this makes the phone last very long throughout the day even through some pretty heavy use. And with the addition of quick charging, makes it lightning fast to charge and get moving.-IP68: This means the phone is dust and water resistant, so if the phone drops in water, there are no worries and it should work perfect after (has always for me)-SD card slot: Bringing this back was a great idea, now you can extend the space by adding a mini-SD card again.-12 MP f/1.7 back camera: This is honestly the best camera I've used on a smartphone in a while, as well as having a great auto-focus feature makes it even betterOnto the downsides,-Bloatware: Comes with a lot of bloatware apps that come preinstalled, pretty annoying but not too big of a problem-Removal of IR Blaster: Not many people did use this, but it was a very nice feature to use for TV's and what not.-Glass back and front, with metal rounded sides: This makes the phone extremely slippery and can be dropped very easily (Best to get a case or skin to make it less slippery)Overall, it is a great phone with great specs. Fast in everything I've done from gaming to watching videos to recording. Have had no issues so far with it. Amazing phone, Samsung."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 16, 2017",5.0,I used a stock version rom and the battery and tweaks are great. If you can afford to buy outright,"This is the way to go for those that do not want bloat from carriers. Got this in two days, rooted, and put on a custom rom right away. This unlocked for carriers and the bootloader is not locked either. I used a stock version rom and the battery and tweaks are great. If you can afford to buy outright, not a payment plan, this is what you should do. The only issue I see is the lack of us warranty, but I am not worried. The phone itself is great. I had a s6  that was driving me crazy as it had lag and design features they took out when they went from the s5 to the s6. The S7 is definitely worth the upgrade as I did not feel the need to get the s8. With the ability to put newer software at my discretion, I will keep the phone for years to come. Mobile International is who I got the phone from and it arrived quickly.The phone has been very responsive, great on battery so far and easy to navigate through items with software updates. The camera works well and my wifi connections have been much better than with the S6 (another reason I switched). The additional memory slot is a welcome return and the camera recognizes when inserted to automatically save pictures there.  This is nice so that it leaves room on the internal memory.I have not tested its ability to resist water (and do not plan it), but overall worth the cost of the phone. I will revise if I have any issues in the future."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 17, 2016",5.0,A Step Up from Xperia,"Above and beyond expectations. I came from the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, which I loved until their version of Android took a Marshmallow-sized dump and massively glitched out, becoming unusable. Sony's ""XPERIA™ Support"" was of absolutely no help in this matter. Before Xperia, I owned the Sony Z3 Compact and the Samsung Galaxy S2. Definitely glad I switched back to Samsung! The grass is NOT greener on the other side, believe me!I'll take Samsung's 12MP over Sony's 23MP any day. Far superior in the areas of auto-focus, low-light, and manual parameters. The Sony Z5 Compact can record 4K video as well, but not without tons of initial lag and post lag (storage, encapsulation). The Samsung S7 is relatively quick with 4K on the initial and reasonable with the post (when you finish recording).And the phone volume is LOUD. Usable, in fact. Sony's Z5 Compact was disappointingly quiet.Great phone."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 9, 2016",5.0,"To my great surprise, Samsung made my dream phone","This being my upgrade from a Sony Xperia Advance (a mid-range smartphone from a few years ago, which was also waterproof), it's perhaps not surprising that I am thoroughly impressed by this device. I had looked at the S6 last year, but it wasn't enough to make me want to buy, in particular given the lack of waterproofing, the lack of expandable storage, and the good but not mind-blowing camera. Samsung has made the S7 everything I had been dreaming of but didn't see in the S6, and I just couldn't say no. On paper, the S7 is my perfect phone.And it turns out it's my perfect phone in practice too.The camera, which was the main selling point for me, lives up to the claims. I have been getting great indoor (and outdoor) shots of my 5-year old in action. With my old phone, that was completely impossible since it would take at least 10 seconds to open the camera app and focus. With the S7, I can go from picking up the locked phone to capturing a perfectly focused image in 3 seconds (I caught my son in mid-air as he jumped off a ramp on his scooter). And the colors are almost always very close to what I perceive with my eye, even in some unusual lighting (like midnight in the arctic in spring, or mixed fluorescent light/sunlight in my living room).The screen is gorgeous as everyone knows. Its resolution is riDONKulous.The phone is a good size for me (good balance between being comfortable in the hand, fitting in the pocket, and having a usefully sized screen). I got a slim Spigen Rugged Armor case for it, which makes me feel much more confident in gripping it (in a way, the phone itself is too thin and smooth and glass), and gives the phone a slightly different but still cool look.Of course, it's expensive. But you're really getting a phone, a palm-top computer (which is as fast as any smartphone out there and therefore fast enough to make any Android 3D game or other app run smoothly), an e-reader, and a better-than-point-and-shoot camera all in one.I definitely recommend this device."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 18, 2016",2.0,I wouldn't make this purchase again.,"This international unlocked version doesn't meet the high standard I felt is in all Samsung S7s.  I can't even use the Samsung + plus app on this phone, an app that  was made for supporting this specific phone. The Camara doesn't capture the quality close ups. I'm not sure why and the seller never replied to my 1st email.In addition, I am unable to run an automatic update for nougat 7.0.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 5, 2017",4.0,... in the Samsung Galaxy S7 but so far I love it,I have not be using  all the functions  in the Samsung Galaxy  S7 but so far I love it
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 6, 2016",5.0,BEAUTIFUL phone.  12 hours in and everything is working great!,"Just received my new phone, upgrading from a broken Galaxy S5.  So far, I love it...First, the color...  My previous Galaxy was a lovely gold color, but I started to wonder whether I was tired of the gold, and whether I should buy the S7 in a different color.  In the end however, I chose gold again.  The great news is that the S7's gold color is a bit more of a bronze color than a true gold, and LOOKS GREAT!  The previous S5 gold was nice, the S7's gold is much nicer!I paired it with an Acmebox gel clear gold cover (only $5.64) on Amazon.  The cover gives full protection (including a lip around the front edges).  Best of all, the clear cover with a hint of gold in it somehow enhances the already fantastic S7 gold cover.  The result is a VERY EXPENSIVE looking phone, for only another $5.64 in investment.The display looks very clear and crisp.  I've always loved Samsung displays, but this definitely improves on the already great S5 display.The phone takes a ""Nano"" SIM card, vs. the ""Micro"" SIM card in my S5.  This means that you can't just plug your existing SIM card into the new phone.  You may have to wait a few days for your carrier to mail you a new one (or visit a store).  However a lot of Micro SIM cards are actually Nano SIM cards that are Micro sized, and you can just punch the extra micro plastic away to break it down to a Nano size.  In my case, I was intially disappointed when I realized that my SIM card wouldn't fit, until I remembered that TMobile had shipped me a new SIM card that I'd kept but never activated.  Sure enough, the new SIM card was a Nano SIM but with the extra perforated plastic to bring it up to Micro size.  Therefore I was able to have TMobile activate it over the phone, and my phone is now usable.I had a bit of a hard time copying my photos and contacts over to the new phone.  Thankfully Android knows that this is an important issue for new phone users, and the start-up software tries multiple ways to get everything over.  In my case, the NFC approach didn't work at all, and the data cable approach (which comes with your phone - thanks guys!) only pulled over apps.  THe back-up to Google also didn't work (maybe it just took too long).  So I went old-school and just backed everything (photos and contacts) up to the SD card, inserted the old SD card into the new phone, and everything transferred fine.Another thing that initially disappointed me was that the phone did not come pre-loaded with a swipe-style keyboard (there was an option for it in the Settings - but it was greyed out).  However at least 2 free swipe-style keyboards were available from the app. store.  I downloaded both the Google as well as the Swiftkey keyboard.  Of the 2, I prefer the Google keyboard (It feels the most like the one on my S5).  Issue solved!One other odd thing to be aware of... Since the back is no longer removable, the tray for the SD and SIM card is on the top of the phone, and can only be opened by an odd-pin-like device that is included with the phone.  I guess its not a big deal since I seldom need to access the SD card.  But it seems odd that I won't be able to open the tray unless I have the pin on me...Overall, I'm very pleased with my new phone.  ...No regrets (and glad I waited for the S7 vs. getting the no-SD-card S6)."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 19, 2016",5.0,"Beautiful phone, works like a charm","I love, love, love my Galaxy S7. I upgraded from an S6, which I also loved--but the charging port went bad and it would no longer charge. Happily, it was still under warrantee. This is my second unlocked phone. I will say that I chose a UK model, which I hope will be better with its warrantee. Because my S6 was Korean, it was quite a hassle to get any help, though I was finally successful. It is no trouble at all to use this with ATT. In fact, I just took the SIM out of my S6 and installed it in the S7 and voila, my phone was functioning. The transfer was a simple wireless affair of sitting the two phones next to each other and waiting a few minutes. Love the camera, Android Pay, and it works great with my Sonata with Android Auto. And it's gorgeous. No iPhone for me!"

If it is stated somewhere and I missed it then I do apologize. But for now, I see this as pure dishonesty. Spend your cash elsewhere...."

My reason for giving only three stars is due to the disappointment experienced when I spent hours trying to fit two nano-sims in the phone tray. One sim card + micro SD card fits very well but the SD card tray does not appear to be designed for a second sim card. A phone technician confirmed that it can't properly fit two sims, thus it may be for one sim + micro card only. It is disappointing because this was one the main reasons I purchased this expensive phone is for two sims. I travel a lot and require two sims."

The only thing is that if you are going to use a case on the phone, I recommend that you buy one with good adherence. Because of the size of it, you dont get a very good grip while handling it with one hand.

As to their product, Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone International Version (Gold) [ASIN: B01CJU8FV4], it came in the official Samsung sealed box, See the attached image.The only thing about this phone is the headphone jack. Its not a US standard jack. Its a little bigger so your existing headphones won’t fit. But they include a pair in the box with the phone. You could always use a Bluetooth head set.It is a US/South American version (Region) so it came in Spanish. During set up you will be in Spanish. In the middle of start screen the screen says Español or Seleccionar idiomain or something like that in faint lettering. Just tap/slide a little above that and it will offer other languages.I would not think twice about doing business with Straight Trading Inc. again."

And ofcourse with the 30 days limit to return or replace the phone, there is nothing I can do about this. It is ridiculous how we can be tricked so easily with these deals.Everything else is working well, but this type of scam just cancels out everything else.Not satisfied at all."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 4, 2016",5.0,Best smartphone in the market!,"Bought it for my mom to replace an old Nexus. Great phone and my mom loves it! it was very easy to transfer all her content and apps from the Nexus to the Samsung using the adapter and app that Samsung provides. It took about 15 min of setting it up and transferring all the data.No special activation was required - I insert the SIM card, turned it on and it works like a charm. Keep in mind this phone uses the nano-sim so if you have an older smartphone, ask your carrier to provide you a new SIM. They should provide this at no charge."

Two days ago it stopped working, the only thing I can see is a black screen and a blue light at the top of the phone and that is all. I tried to reset or restart the phone, but nothing worked. Unfortunately, I have just read the comments and learned that many people had the same problem. So if you are reading comments considering buying this phone. My recommendation is clear, don't buy it.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 18, 2016",5.0,S7 is a saweet phone.,I ordered the S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G930F - Black Oynx. After contacting the seller to make sure it was a authentic international they assured me it was. When I first received it I looked for the original box and it was. I took the phone out and turned it on to make sure it was real and not a fake. It was just like he said it was a authentic  international S7.I have had the phone just over 2 weeks now and love it. It takes awesome pictures even in low light. I really like the video quality. You can even do slo motion or hyper speed. I am still learning all this phone can do. I would suggest getting a 128 gig or bigger sd card and a cover because it does show fingerprints and is a bit slippery. I am very happy with the phone and the seller!
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 19, 2016",5.0,VERY VERY HAPPY,I'm very happy with the phone Its exactly how it was described

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 26, 2016",4.0,"Fast, Sleek, Disappointing lack of an IR blaster","Alright, I got my s7 around late march,  (yes, just in time to miss every special offer with the gear vr) and I have to say, I absolutely love this phone. It is, as expected, the FASTEST phone I have ever had, considering it has better processing speeds than normal computers did a few years ago, and it looks GREAT. Yes, they did come with android upgrades in general, but Samsung has made MASSIVE improvements to their UI, ease of access connection speeds, and an amazing screen just overall. However, there are some issues that I have with it, things I wish were included, and just overall some comments about the phone and features1) BATTERY LIFE. Now, I understand that people have been commending it for its battery life, but I personally find it running out all too often. It seems that every flagship phone of this generation has been jumping on the Quad-HD bandwagon, and the s7 is no different. Yes, it looks slightly better, but, according to logic and IN MY EXPERIENCE, it drains battery life WAY faster than the max 1080p screen of old. One of the main differences between this device, and the LG G3 ,the flagship that basically pioneered the Quad-HD phone space, is that the s7 does not have a removable battery. On top of that, there is the adaptive display, which unlike 2k, (Quad-HD) makes a huge difference, making the screen extremely vibrant and attractive. HOWEVER, this drains a ton of battery too in my experience; thankfully you can turn it off. Also, is it just me, or does the battery DRAIN faster when charged with fast charge, too.2) PHYSICAL GLASS. Alright, I'm going to be perfectly honest, most of this is more of a pro than a con, but I would just like to comment on the corning gorilla glass 4 that this phone has both on front and back. The glass on the front I'd say is pretty great. I have for some reason treated this phone worse than I have with any other, but it's held up amazingly. There are minimal scratches and even after a freak Pokemon Go accident that would've completely shattered the screen of any phone I've ever had, it was left with a small CHIP in the right-hand corner. Yes, a CHIP. Now, I know by the way I said it, it sounds like a bad thing, but I thought it was amazing. I mean, I threw that thing HARD, and I think, the fact that it chipped rather than shatter into a million pieces was a REALLY good thing(picture of crack attached[if you can even see it]). Now for the back. I hate that it has a glass back. Yes, it looks nice, and yes, I always have a case protecting it anyway, but for those who don't believe in cases, and like many users, hate the active series, I don't care what kind of glass you put on the back, it will not be as durable as a GOOD metal back.3) Lack Of An IR Blaster. Now I know this was an unusual feature to be integrated into a smartphone in the first place, but I really do miss the IR blaster. It was so very convenient to be able to replace every remote in your house without separate, $100-300 hardware. Yes, it was a little finicky, but I think that calls for improvement, not SCRAPPING IT ENTIRELY.  I get it though, it was a thing that no average user really used, or even KNEW about, and that made it not worth even including because it raised the production value, but I LIKED IT. It was VERY NICE.4) WATERPROOFING. This one is most definitely a pro. I quite like the waterproofing of the s7. As I said, I have treated this phone worse than any I have ever had, and that includes taking it places where I thought it might get really wet, like I mean soaking. Well, it has held up amazingly so far, accidental drops in sinks and similar things proved to be absolutely nothing to this phone, and I have tested it in the very hot shower with great results.5) SAMSUNG PAY. Alright, I'll say it, I love Samsung Pay. It is so convenient, and hilarious blowing cashiers' minds wherever you go. Although, there are some issues with this too, however pretty minor and some easily fixable. The few issues that I have with samsung pay are:A) the lack of support for banks and credit cards that are not partnered with Samsung. I understand that this could be for a few reasons, either some banks are too small, neither are nor wish to be associated with Samsung, and for security reasons, but that doesn't change that you just can't use some cards on samsung play that you would very much like to use, and that I believe that Samsung could fix this by pushing harder to partner with every bank they can, even if it means setting up the systems for them.B) The difficulty involved with the use of Samsung Pay. This includes the fact that getting the card to read is pretty difficult, and even if you know how to do it perfectly, sometimes it takes a couple tries, and the ignorance of just about every snarky cashier on Earth, not letting you even attempt to pay with Samsung Pay, because ""they don't have the system set up.""Overall, as I said, this is an amazing phone, great choice for a flagship, but there are some issues, missed opportunities, and good things that stood out about the galaxy s7 that I thought were worth mentioning in this review. And I realize this was probably a very negative sounding review in contrast to my ratings, but I really do love this phone, I just think the good things don't really need explainingNOTE: This is my own written review, HOWEVER, I previously posted it on the Samsung website as an entry to a sweepstakes. Also, I did not purchase the phone from amazon, nor did I purchase mine unlocked, so I cannot speak to the compatibility of this unlocked item with different sim cards, but I felt the need to post it here, as it is the exact same product, and this is the listing directly from Samsung.PICTURE: The chip on my screen mentioned above"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 31, 2016",3.0,Samsung S7  good and curiously deficient.....both ....,The charger is  way too complicated....and using European plugs  and  three different adapters to get it charged is a curious way to  sell a phone....

The camera quality is great and when adding an online storage option you never have to worry about space.  I bought this phone because they put the SD card slot back which allowed me to put a 128GB card in to give more space.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is currently looking to upgrade.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 26, 2017",3.0,Selfie camera problem,"If you intend to take quality selfies with this phone then think again.I noticed the first selfie seemed smooth without any details and immediately tried to turn off Beauty Mode. After no luck still, I Googled for 'S7 blurry front camera' and found others with the same problem as me.It turns out that the front camera is not focusing on subjects right in front of it but to infinity instead. The result is sharp backgrounds and out-of-focus foreground subjects with a smooth look.Apparently the issue only exists on S7's made in Vietnam and not the ones coming from Korea but I'm not sure how to tell which one you're getting.Even though I don't take selfies, I ended up returning the phone because I see it as defective.Besides this one issue, I still think the phone and the rear camera is superb."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 28, 2017",5.0,Great phone! Great screen resolution,Great phone! Great screen resolution! Looks new! Works great! I only wish the screan would be a little bit bigger and i wish it still be possible to replace the battery like before. I only had it for one day so far.I already had this phone for over a month. So far so good.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 26, 2016",4.0,Would be perfect if the keyboard was like the US version,"Great except for the keyboard isn't normal. No way to get the symbols above the letters in your keyboard unless you download an app, but in the app I used, the layout was still a little weird and it drove me crazy. Also, you can't see when people have read your texts (if they have an S7 and have read receipts on, then it should) also, you can't see the dots when people with S7 are typing back.  I ended up returning this one because of these things, and I just went to my t mobile store and got the US version. The US version does seem to get a lot hotter though, so that's one plus about the international version since it was much cooler. I knew this before purchasing the international version and still bought it because these features didn't matter to me, but it's good information to know that Samsung pay and VOLTE do not work on the international version."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 21, 2016",5.0,This is a great phone by Wireless Everything with Samsung,"This is a great phone by Wireless Everything with Samsung. They provided me with the best and genuine product on there on the smartphone market today. I was quite skeptical on this company at first because it is an online store, but I took a gamble and it was a definitely a great option as I checked my phone's capabilities and software and I can tell you that this company and phone is the ""real deal."" Everything was shipped on time and my phone came in some good package so it was not damaged. I highly recommend this phone to the public because it is quite cheaper than what the carriers offer such as Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, or Sprint. This phone works great on all four major American phone carriers and even the tinier carriers such as Virgin, Cricket, or more. Thumbs up to this phone."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 30, 2016",5.0,This phone is just ridiculous in such a good way...,"Excellent phone especially considering how much you can gut and alter the software performance even without root. Plus the Exynos processor runs SO SMOOTH (supposedly much moreso than the US Snapdragon phones).BE AWARE: If you want one with Samsung Pay you are SOL for the moment. These are Panamanian region phones (or at least the one I recieved was) that are allowed to work in the US. You will get updates when that region gets updates from Samsung (such as the Samsung Pay rollout). Trying to change this /might/ trip KNOX (flashing a different region's ROM I think will do this, but I am unsure) and leave you unable to get Samsung Pay anyway. That said, that is literally the only reason I can think of not to get this phone. The operating system (Touchwiz) is more full-featured than normal Android and the mild bit of Samsung bloat preinstalled can be disabled with the right apps such as Package Disabler Pro.I rooted it and have no complaints. If you want a marginally faster phone with mildly clunkier peripherals and something like $100 - $200 cheaper then get a OnePlus 3. Otherwise, just turn off or speed up phone animations from the developer settings section and you will have a comparably snappy phone anyway.You can't really lose with this phone. It has some of the best peripherals AND is neck and neck with the best Android phones in terms of software. Or get the Snapdragon Edge version for a larger battery. Unless you have brand loyalties then the best phones you can buy are probably the Galaxy S7/S7 Edge/7 Note, OnePlus 3, or the upcoming Apple phones (without diving into the whole gimmicky market of 8GB Asian phones that may run fast but have other large weakpoints).OnePlus 3: best internals, fairly good externalsUpcoming iPhone: probably yet another super snappy masterpiece stuck in the Apple's software market. With an OS specifically tailored to the hardware it runs on its really REALLY hard for any Android phone to beat an iPhone in speed. Apple people will love this. Kudos to them.Galaxy S7/S7 Edge/Note 7 (Exynos): pretty much Android's iPhone by this point. Not QUITE as snappy but you get the whole market of Android apps which is staggeringly large by this point. User is less restricted by bulls*** lioe thay imposed by Apple like Apple's music services deleting songs not downloaded through the service for example.Anyway, started detouring. Great phone. If you can afford the premium, do not want an Apple phone, do not want Samsung Pay (at least immediately), and are not perturbed by it running oh-so-marginally slower than a OnePlus 3 then this is your phone (especially if you are willing to do RAM/battery tweaks). No regrets."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 2, 2017",5.0,Worth every penny!!,I've had this phone for about 2 years & I still love it!! The camera is amazing & I love the swipe keyboard. Also great phone for us clumsy people :3 dropped it without case or screen protector more times than I can count & not even a scratch on the screen :O
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 26, 2016",5.0,Great Phone!!!!!,"The packaging was great, brand new phone. The phone works great! Definitely an upgrade from the HTC One M9 that I had. The camera takes super great pictures and the display on the phone is A+. I could not recommend this phone more! It does require a sim card, so if you have AT&T it'll work just fine. The battery is also an upgrade from my HTC! My HTC would take long to charge and died quickly. This Galaxy S7 lasts me the whole day and charges very fast. Overall a great phone, definitely should by!"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 26, 2016",4.0,Best phone on the market!,"Well, I don't need to write about the galaxy s7. If you buy one you probably know how nice samsung phones are. And this one is also. Works perfectly fine!The only thing that annoys me about mine is that in the ""about device"" section in settings it says United Arab Emirates and not USI don't know much about android and so far it has not affected me. I hope it stays like that also when I return to Europe."

My only complaint is my phone is not even a month old yet and my charger is beginning to mess up so I may be buying a replacement charger soon.  Other than that, I LOVE THIS PHONE!"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 24, 2016",4.0,"Not quite equivalent of US T-Mobile phone, beware","For folks in the US to be aware of, the phone doesn't work with WiFi calling. This appears to be a feature that is only included with phones directly from T-Mobile. Visual Voicemail works, but it took me a little while to get it working. Fast network speeds seemed to be indicated with an ""H+,"" rather than ""4GLTE."" I haven't tested to see whether it is equivalent speed.  I presume it's a European symbology. The display is very nice, and the apps work as expected. The camera is particularly nice. It's also very slippery in my hand. I miss the grippy back of the S5. Finally, I haven't bothered getting a screen protector, since the front of the screen is curved, so normal screen protectors don't work. The glass seemed pretty tough, though. The charger uses the European plug style, but it comes with an adapter. The adapter makes it quite bulky compared to the US plug, but it's not that big of a deal, as long as you're not trying to plug it in behind a cabinet, desk, etc."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 6, 2017",2.0,"Everything else worked fine, I issued a return process because of this ...","Front facing camera is blurry. I understand it doesn't ""focus"" but when you take a picture the focus is on the farthest thing (infinity focus), so no matter how I position myself I will always come out soft-focused. Everything else worked fine, I issued a return process because of this issue."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 1, 2016",5.0,Perfect smartphone,"Perfect, changes fast in one hour to near 100% from near discharge. Battery usage when idle is really low so if you don't use it often it will last more than one day without recharging. Screen, construction and speed are perfect.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 11, 2016",5.0,Great phone,Hi. I received the phone today.  I was nicely suprised when I found out that it was shipped almost right after I ordered!!! It came the day it should.I'm using it with attractive go phone and it started working right after inserting sim card. after few hours I really like it. It seems like it doesn't  have lte just 4g and sometimes  H+ but it still works. It doesn't have Samsung pay but I was expecting it as I did some research. I'm not sure about battery  life.  In 3 hours it went from 52 to 11% and I have battery saving on but I will see. I will dry to drain it and that charge it all the way. I will come back with more updates.Mine was sold by wireless everything. They  really send it out fast!!!

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 23, 2016",1.0,one Stars,"LIARS !! you have sold to us 1 of Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone International Version (Black) , now we have contacted samssung due to some problems with the phone and beside the warranty they told us that the phone sold for you it is not an international unlocked phone. this phone is only for use in south africa, and this was not mentioned at ANY part of the description, this phone is not intenational unlocked, it unlocked but only for south africa. and the phone doesnt work ."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 19, 2016",4.0,Galaxy S7 is GREAT! Except...,"Super fast, very nice camera, screen is gorgeous, battery life is exceptional and build quality is excellent. One downside, which is a big one, is the speaker is very tinny. Sounds like a blown car speaker. Absolutely no bass whatsoever. BUT... it's not THAT bad. Considering the phone is waterproof! Rate 7/10. Near perfect. I expect something crazy for the S8 from what this phone can do. You won't be disappointed. LTE speeds in USA is 5/1 with AT&T. I have the international unlocked version. It was 100$ cheaper lol."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 14, 2016",1.0,Warranty of broken phone may not work at all!,"I was very surprised with this order and cannot recommend it to anyone. The warranty can be very tricky when the phone is broken. Even if you are willing to send the phone by international mail to repair.The real first contact with water at Niagara falls (rain and drops of the fall) lead to oxidation of the main board and battery (based on Samsung Czech Republic findings). So, the repair is very expensive. Really tricky for the phone with IP68 certification (dust proof and water resistant over 1.5 meter and 30 minutes). I tried to contact the seller  to give me some advises how to repair it under warranty. They simply stop to respond to my first set of questions. Their response in another attempt was unbelievable "" Water damaged items are not covered under any manufacturer warranties.""I am still waiting for the response from Samsung Czech Republic. Hopefully they will give me better answers."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 9, 2017",4.0,"Came as described, BRAND NEW and works beautifully with Cricket.",Item came as described BRAND NEW and has so far (1st week) worked beautifully with Cricket. My only complaint is that an end of the sticker seal peeled off during shipping which made the phone's box open slightly but luckily the stuffing in the shipping box prevented the contents from moving too much and nothing happened to the phone. Overall satisfied with Mobiles International LLC and my purchase.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 18, 2016",1.0,Phones had more negatives than positives,Very disappointed by the phone overall. The price was 630ish on Amazon better on here than the retail price at store at the time. However after over a year of use I found various problems.1st and the price dropping dramatically I regret this purchase.2nd I dislike the glass unlike everyone else. It's not very durable and HATE THE CURVED EDGE!!! This is not the S7 edge either just the standard S7. This is my major issue that made me never want to buy another Samsung Galaxy. This phone doesn't allow any screen protector to work properly. The factory will fix it for for a small price of 200 (ridiculous).3rd the screens adhesive comes off after several months of use. It started on the corner and continuously spread half an inch. It looked bad enough that I payed to get it fixed. So much for water proof4th 2 replacement screen's had damaged lcds after I replaced it. So much for finding a functioning replacement screen. Wasted my time trying to fix a manufacturing defect that shouldn't have occurred in the first placeThe only good thing about this phone was the camera. Which after all the hassle I found its not worth it. If your going to buy a phone for the camera get a Sony. I'm not a sponsor or get paid but no one can compare to Sony s camera in my opinion

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 30, 2016",3.0,Great phone but batter life sucks.,Better life sucks... however omg the camera on this phone is great.  I would recommend getting a phone case cause this phone is very slippery and you will drop it alot. Overall great phone for adults not teenagers cause the battery sucks and teenagers like to use their phone all day. Lastly it take awhile for the phone to charge fully.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 16, 2016",3.0,It is a great product don't get me wrong,It is a great product don't get me wrong. The problem is that we are not offered any insurance that can come along with this phone. My phone screen just stopped working and cant turn on. Its been 6 months since I bought this phone I haven't had a problem with it since 2 or 3 months ago. Its an okay phone.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 13, 2017",5.0,Overall its been a great experience. Will come back in 6 months to ...,"No overheating problems as reported. Working very well on AT&T. The SIM/MicroSD card slot isn't fragile but not really firm either - We don't take it out much, just need to be careful. The package had international wall charger, however the seller included a US socket converter. Looks new - and have new information about warranty. The phone's Model / Serial / IMEI number is on the sticker on the back of the phone. Find the 7th and 8th digit of IMEI and that will give you the phone's country of origin. Mine was 08 which is Germany. Went to Samsung Germany page, and was able to register my phone. It confirms 2 yr warranty. Overall its been a great experience. Will come back in 6 months to report usage."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 2, 2016",1.0,I received a faulty product,"I ordered this phone in June. Started using it in July and it worked great for 2 weeks - and then stopped.First the EMMC chip (flash chip) fried and then after I got that fixed (for about 132$) the power management IC went as well.Amazon is not willing to take the product back because more then 30 days have passed, not for a full or even partial refund and they are not willing to exchange the product for a new one either.I called Samsung and they can't register the  phones IMEI number because it's an internationally sourced phone so they won't help me either.Basically I'm out over 700$ for a phone that does not work.My recommendation - if you want to buy a Samsung device, buy one that is NOT internationally sourced, that way if there are problems, you can contact Samsung in the US and have them take care of it.UPDATE: Aamazon gave me a full refund for the device and I am returning it to them. I still think it would be better to get a phone that is not internationally sourced.Samsung Galaxy S7 Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - Internationally sourced (EU/LATAM) version  G930F- Platinum Gold"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 18, 2016",5.0,Awesome!,Love it! Got this to use on T-Mobile US and it's been great! Came with Italy firmware (which didn't support Samsung Pay) so I flashed the Australian firmware and Samsung Pay is working great. Good signal strength and I've even seen Band 12 ... Really happy with this purchase!
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 21, 2017",4.0,The charger alone,The charger it comes with literally charges my phone to full in like 45 minutes from 0%. This phone is amazing. It can literally do everything. It loses a star because it's been almost a year and it went from lasting a few days without charge to only lasting a day.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 27, 2017",5.0,DOES work on cricket,"This listing contains an error. This phone DOES work on cricket and I have been using it on cricket since August 2016. It does not have LTE bands but it does have 4G GSM bands. Cricket caps data at 8mbps down speed though, which is in 4G range and not LTE anyway, so that didn't really matter. I notice no speed issues against my boyfriend's cricket USA model.I love this phone for multiple reasons. I work for a Verizon retailer and I very much dislike the amount of bloatware on carrier phones. This phone has no carrier bloatware and very little Samsung bloat.It was recently updated to nougat and it's even snappier than ever. Rarely every has lag issues. And things load even faster than before.I travel a lot so I needed a phone that could work in Europe. I popped a Swisscom sim in this guy last time I was in Europe and I had no issues. Piece of cake.It is waterproof. I run mine under the faucet at least once a day to get the oils off. Keeps the phone looking nicer and the germs at bay.I paired this guy with a UAG case and QMadix liquid glass screen protector. If you haven't tried those yet I highly suggest it. It fills in the pores of the glass and is as strong as sapphire, except you don't even know anything is there. I put it on both the front and back of the phone. It also keeps fingerprints at a minimum and is easier to clean.The camera on this phone blows my iPhone away. I have blown these photos up to 20"" and they rival my Nikon d5000. Amazing.My only complaint is that it doesn't group text. I'm not sure if that's from it being international version or what, since my boyfriend's cricket version s7 doesn't have that issue, but that's minor. Things just come in under the specific contact and not in one giant thread."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 5, 2017",5.0,Five Stars,it`s ok
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 10, 2016",1.0,Repeatedly locking now on Android updates.,"Original review: Just received today, and just a couple minor glitches, but am otherwise expecting this phone to be as great as promised.  So just a few comments.1.  Do charge the battery before first use. And, yes, charging is fast.2.  This phone takes a NANO sim card.  That's smaller than my prior sim, so necessitated a trip into a local AT&T store for a new sim.  Which was relatively quick, after a wait, and the phone, yes, unlocked phone, readily worked fine.3.  Prior to heading into AT&T, though, I was able to complete most of the initial phone set up using my local Wi-Fi connection.  Neat.  But I did notice that the phone felt a bit warm during this process.  I now have the phone in a case, and no longer feels warm, though that could be somewhat due to the case.  But after initial, I didn't really notice my warmth from the phone either.4.  Battery remaining % is displayed right on the lock screen.  Nice.  But battery life does seem to fall off fairly quickly.  But will let this battery discharge and recharge a few times, and then see where things stand.5.  My granddaughter asked why I got a smaller phone, but I'm hoping that with this higher resolution to not miss my former larger phone.  Time will tell.6.  My biggest con?  The screen covering the speaker located on the bottom edge is applied at an angle and appears damaged and crunched.  Speaker is fine, best that I can tell, and so I am not interested in returning for a small cosmetic.  Still, I'd have preferred that QC had caught.  So dinging one star.Update Oct 2, 22016.  I'm thinking I made a real mistake shelling out big bucks for this phone.  It has now locked up five time in the last three weeks, getting very hot each time. So far, it has come back each time after letting battery die over 24 hours and then recharging.  All started with an Android OS update.  And did again today as I was hoping this new update would fix the last one.  No such luck.  I'll consider myself lucky if the phone is not bricked.  Thinking seriously of trying a custom ROM, as what have I got to lose."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 14, 2016",5.0,"Great device, but AT&T's support for unlocked devices is crap","Great device. Functions completely as advertised. Won't bother restating the many reviews online. One thing to watch for is that in the USA AT&T's support for unlocked devices seems to be crap. If you have any issue connecting your device to AT&T and they can't fix it in 5 minutes, they won't do anything else to help you. That said, the device did connect to AT&T and to T-Mobile. LTE speeds on T-Mobile were about 3 times faster than on AT&T. Switching to T-Mobile for the speed, better plans, and better support for unlocked devices."

Usually it takes a while to make the phone start charging. Today it does not work at all after just a couple of months. Now I'm wondering if Best Buy sells converters. I'm sooo pissed. These international versions should not be sold in the USA at all. IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE TO PURCHASE THIS PHONE!
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 4, 2016",5.0,Incredibly Great Phone," The Galaxy S7 nails just about everything that matters: great build, good looks, expandable memory, fantastic screen, best in class battery life, and top notch camera.  It's hard to find fault with the S7, but if I had to find a complaint it would be that the speaker isn't as loud as I'd like.  Watch the video for my impressions and thoughts, and feel free to post questions - I'll answer if I can!*****U.S. buyers please note that the Galaxy S7 G930F model is an international phone.  It will work just fine in the U.S. BUT YOU LIKELY HAVE NO WARRANTY COVERAGE!!!  I would strongly urge you to consider purchasing a 3rd party warranty if you buy this for use in the U.S. (feel free to contact Samsung to confirm warranty coverage or lack thereof).  My last phone was the LG G4 international model, and it died after 9 months.  To my surprise LG would not repair the phone & explained that they do not offer warranty coverage to US customers who purchased an international phone.  I have learned that this is common, so be careful!*****"

The quick-response feature is wonderful. Pair this with the Samsung quick-charge pad and never plug it in again. I came from an S5 and there is a noticeable difference in speed and processing power. The camera shutter speed is lightning-fast: instantaneous. Haven't seen it in low-light or concerts yet. I can't find any faults with this other than the battery is't removable anymore but that wasn't worth a ""star"" to me. This runs on a nano sim card, which the S5 had a micro sim chip. At&T gave me one (SIM) for free when I dropped in and gave them my phone IMEI. Enjoy this phone because Samsung got it right... again!"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 7, 2016",5.0,Galaxy S7 - the new wonder by Samsung :),"I was waiting for this new wonder by Samsung and atlast I got it in my hand. Out of Black, white , Gold and Silver I chose the gold one. No doubt Samsung has again shown its creativity in its new launch Galaxy S7.I will start with not so impressive points of this new tech wonder-1) Similar look to S6- It looks so similar to older version S6 in design. At least a new version should have differences from its predecessors not only by features but also by look. Both of them are same by size, look , height , width. Only slight differences are there by look. S6 is more flat at the back whereas S7 has curved panel.The rear camera in s6 sticks out a bit whereas in S7 the camera is more flat.2) No Type c USB - I will miss my nexus Type c usb connector in S7 which I really enjoy in my google nexus 5X. S again I will be missing my fast charging here which is most needed when you are in a hurry and want to get your phone atleast half charged within a couple of minutes.3) No 3D touch- I love 3D touch of my iPhone 6S plus which I will be missing in this S7.Now the best and most impressive sides of S7 are -1) Better camera than S6-  In spite of the significant megapixel difference in camera between S6 and S7 ( S6 has 16 MP rear camera where as S7 has 12 mp rear camera ) I would say the camera is much better than S6 . Pictures comes solid in S7 and you will not have a chance to think about the megapixel difference.2) Waterproof phone- Yeah, Samsung has created the wonder fully waterproof which is savior to those worries if your phone accidentally gets dropped in water.3) Better battery performance - Combo of 3000 mah battery and android marshmallow featuring long lasting battery will make S7 horse of a long race.4) Micro SD card support- It supports Micro SD card which is a win win over S6.I am using this phone and have no complaints still now and pretty happy with my golden S7."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 25, 2017",4.0,This phone is really nice it works well and is pretty fast,This phone is really nice it works well and is pretty fast. But after looking at the one-star reviews I'm hoping that this phone doesn't have any problems especially because it has no warranty. Another thing about the phone is that it's really slippery even with the case that I bought. It's not as grippy as my old phone but it sure does work better with a really nice back and front camera. I will keep you guys updated about the performance of the phone and if I'm running into any problems after weeks/months hopefully the phone still works after months because this is a really nice phone.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"November 11, 2016",1.0,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 5 MONTHS - DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this phone in May and it stopped working in October.  First it would reboot constantly then it would not start and had a blue light.  I tried every remedy recommended online including a factory reset and nothing worked.  Now it will not even charge and will not power on.This is clearly a defective model and worse yet, there is a 1 yr warranty listed on the item's page but it's a lie!  I called Samsung and they said it cannot be serviced in the US and likewise, Amazon said they will do nothing.This seller is selling a bad phone and Amazon is doing a bad job protecting the consumer - regardless, I will find a way to get my refund or replacement device even though this process has been very crooked on Amazon's part."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 17, 2016",4.0,"Great Phone, Too Fragmented","The GS7 is an awesome device.  However, if you're getting the international G930F, know that Samsung pay won't work and Android Pay will be limited.  In addition, if you're expecting faster updates from Samsung, just know they have the G930F extremely fragmented by country and specific firmware to each country... so not all will receive updates as fast as you might expect for a ""carrier free"" device. That said, the Exynos processor on the G930F is superior to the Snapdragon processor in the US variant, as is the battery life."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 26, 2016",5.0,Works Perfectly on AT&T,"Worked perfectly out of the box, although I had the Micro SIM from my S5 Active trimmed down to a Nano, but the AT&T store did it for free.

It will say checking for updates, it subsequently shows a happy droid or a dead droid (asterixes for eyes) and a yellow triangle with exclamation point. If the latter is the case the phone is rooted, this has been confirmed several times with Samsung officials. Means someone tried to install an unofficial operating system.

It was so easy to set up!  I backed up my iPhone data onto Google, took the T-Mobile sim card out of the iPhone, placed it in this phone, and followed the set up procedures on the phone.  The plug was international with an adapter for U.S. outlets.  The cord has a micro USB to the phone and a USB on the outlet end, so I can use my old iPhone power blocks (super nice to be able to recycle phone cord parts)!  It has 32GB storage with a second slot for a microSD card, so I also purchased an $80 200GB microSD memory card for extra file, photo, and music storage.

Sent in the phone to their repair center in a Plano Texas. Apparently it was a battery issue and they ""repaired"" it. They sent back phone and I received it completely damaged. The screen was completely inked out. They initially wanted to blame UPS but there was no apparent damage to the box or packaging. They finally owned up to the damage but was completely unhelpful with going about resolving the issue. They had the audacity to say normally I would be charged to fix the screen THEY damaged.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 27, 2016",5.0,Good experience with AT&T network,"I'm not reviewing the GS7. It's a great phone. I'm very happy with it. I'm reviewing the seller. I received a new sealed GS7 for Italy I believe (TIM) is the carrier. plugged the micro sim from my AT&T GS6 and went through the usual startup process. Everything went perfect. I set the language to english and I'm using AT&T's 4g LTE network. I didn't have to add any AP names or anything. It just worked. It's seems to be just as good or bad as the GS6 (AT&T branded) that I was using before. I was also able to uninstall all the TIM apps, which has not been my experience with AT&T and other US carriers. I can usually disable most of them but not uninstall completely. If I bought this from AT&T it would have cost about $200 more (crazy that the price is still the same as when it was released since it will likely be replaced in 3 months with the GS8) and I would have been forced to reprovision a new sim card for some reason which would take time which is the same as more money and I would have a bunch of AT&T apps taking up memory."

Other than that...no complaints thus far...the camera is an AMAZING upgrade from my S5...also I was pleasantly surprised that it has front flash. I live in the Caribbean(SVG)....phone works absolutely fine here....whatsapp messages were coming through as soon as i put my sim card in and turned on my mobile data. Highly reccomend :)"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 10, 2016",5.0,This phone is Beautiful! The materials they put into it are top ...,"(I did purchase this phone from this page and decided to do a quick review of it)This phone was everything I could have asked for. I always had this predisposition that the Samsung phones were made with lower quality materials, but I was dead wrong. This phone is Beautiful! The materials they put into it are top notch and in my personal opinion this device looks and feels much better than the iPhones!When I first got I was worried because I was switching from Apple to Android, which can be a pretty daunting change. BUT the transition did not seem to take long at all. I got into the phone pretty quickly and was doing my normal daily tasks in no time.It is sad that I had to give up FaceTime but I feel like it was worth it and my friends quickly adapted and started calling me on Skype or Oovoo instead.Unlike the name says, this phone did actually come with some type of warranty I believe. On the box there was a ""24 month warranty"" sticker,.. So I am assuming that means I have a warranty!I also was curious to see which phone is faster (the iPhone 6s Plus vs the Samsung Galaxy S7) so I ran a few easy tests. In getting into apps, the Samsung got in just a hair faster. In loading webpages, the Samsung again beat the iPhone just by a hair.The camera on the Samsung is by far the superior camera when there is ample amount of lighting but in low light, I would give it to the iPhone. The front-facing camera, works the same way. In low light the iPhone wins, but with enough light, the Samsung does better.There are many really cool customization options on the Android software that you would have to jailbreak your iPhone to do, and with the type of person I am I feel like the Android software works better for me. On the other hand, Android may be more confusing to use. Things are not always quite right there where you want them to be and you have have to search for them. BUT Android helps you out with this with search bars when they are convenient.Overall this device is everything I could have asked for. I really enjoy it and I hope I can continue enjoying it for as long as possibly"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 4, 2016",5.0,Samsung at Their Best,"DesignSamsung's phones are very similar to the S6-Note 5 range from last year. The new models still are made of glass (it is Corning Gorilla Glass 4, which is very high quality and durable). The looks are still fantastic and the black, gold, and silver titanium colors looks premium. The colors no longer have hidden colors that show up in sunlight, as the black color is simply just a jet black and same for the gold. The silver titanium has a mirror like finish to it, so it is still reflective.The Galaxy S7 brings the welcome return of dust and water resistance. It is now IP68 certified and is water resistant up to 3 feet and 30 minutes. I find this to be a great return to form and something that should be mandatory for all phones moving forward.CameraThe 12MP camera on the back is very good, but I honestly feel like it’s not as great as the Galaxy S6’s camera. Samsung actually reduced the megapixel count and I feel like it shows. Samsung has stated that due to improved image software and better pictures in low light conditions, it is a worthy tradeoff, but I don’t feel like it was worth it completely. It comes with OIS to help with image stabilization and the camera loads extremely fast. You can load it by clicking on the icon on the home or lock screens or my favorite way: by double clicking the home button. The delay is less than a second which is impressive. The images look great on the screen, but unlike the 2015 models, you lose more detail when enlarging them on the phone and on a computer screen/when printing them out.The 5MP front facing camera is still very good. It has a wide field of vision and takes stellar pictures. It also has a front facing flash which is nice and helpful in low light conditions.DisplayAnother year later and it is still hard to find a better looking display. It’s a 5.1-inch screen and 577 pixels per inch, which creates an unbelievably great looking screen. It is bright, detailed, and showcases amazing color accuracy.AudioThe audio is good and loud. I do wish the Galaxy S7 would take cues from some of their competition and utilize front facing stereo speakers. When holding the phone in landscape mode and watching a video on say Netflix, it is a little hard to hear at times due to the fact that the sound is only coming out the right or left side only.BatteryThe battery has been bumped up to a 3,000 mAh battery and it shows. The battery life is superior to last year’s model and does a great job of getting me through the day. The turbo charging is still excellent, but the wireless charging also had some issues with staying connected, and I’m using the official Samsung wireless charger.FunctionalityThe Always on Display function is nice and useful at times, but I have found it to also be distracting due to one flaw. If you have your phone on your desk at work or by your computer, it is a distraction because the clock will jump around the screen every few minutes. This is due to Samsung wanting to reduce the risk of screen burn in, where if an image is in the same spot all the time, it runs the potential of frying out that particular spot on the screen. That is all well and good, but ideally I would use the Always on Display to silently know if I receive an important text or call. When the screen jumps around, I find my eye wanders to it every time not knowing if it’s lighting up to show a new text or if it’s just simply shifting around.The themes option out of the Samsung store is great and has grown a lot since last year. It allows you to completely customize how you want your backgrounds, keyboard, text messages, and overall aesthetic to look. It is a bit unfortunate to see more and more of the themes to no longer be free like they were when the theme store was first launched.The phone itself works well, although at times there is an issue with lag and app crashes. It was running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and everything worked nicely for the most part. Samsung has gone back to using a Snapdragon processor after spending last year utilizing their own chipset. The Snapdragon 820 processor of this year is incredibly fast and the 820 is marked improvement over the 810 which would get too hot and stutter at times. This coupled with the 4GB of RAM makes the phone blaze through almost any task with minimal issues. It is among the fastest and most reliable phones I have ever used.  This, combined with the 4GB of RAM the S7 has, means that the phone is up for any task with amazing speed.The fingerprint sensor still feels not as fast and accurate as some of the better options out there. It is accurate I’d say 75% of the time, but sometimes it can be very finicky which is frustrating due to the fact that it’s meant to be both fast and more secure.With Android, you get more customizability in terms of launchers, themes, widgets and colors than you do with Apple’s IOS, but you also have to wait longer for updates, have potentially more issues with security, and have an app store that isn’t as fleshed out or monitored as Apple’s is. Android definitely is for those who want more customizability and are adept/willing to do a little bit more tinkering with it to set it up just the way they want it.I enjoy Touchwiz and the added options Samsung provides. It allows for things like an improved Calendar from stock Android (it shows more information on the month view), added customization tweaks and a multi window to be multitask, although I still can’t see why a basic app like the calculator can’t work there in landscape mode.I am very glad to see the expandable storage options of the past return. It is convenient to be able to improve the storage to 256GB which should be more than enough for most people and the 32GB base is great as well.If you would like to read more of my reviews, please check out: smartphonehaven.com"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 23, 2016",5.0,PERFECT? LETS SEE.,"Before the S7, I had a note 5, I've still kept it around but it has been 2 days and I thought I should give you a brief review of my first impressions,Improvements over the Note 5 -1) The screen looks much better and even more vibrant. My secondary phone is an iPhone and it is nowhere near the vibrancy of the Samsung display but if you're playing a video on youtube at 720p resolution on the S7 and Note 5, the S7 is at least 20% better. I could not believe the difference so I had my wife do a double take on it as well and she confirmed its far better.2) The sound is less muffled and a lot louder, audible - its still like a loud mini-speaker but it is definitely a step in the right direction3) The battery size on this phone is 3000mah and the screen is 5.1""  and since the new processor is more power efficient, this basically translates to a better battery life. Of course I can't expect the same over the coming months since Samsung hasn't really nailed their power efficiency over the course of a possible android upgrade...what I am saying is when Android N comes around, I dont know if the power will still be good. My experience between the Lollipop and the Android marshmallow upgrade was not so good (on note 5) but for now the bottom line is I am getting well over 30 hours of battery with moderate to heavy usage4) The Note 5 camera was lovely and the Samsung S7 is even better. The 5.1"" size actually helps in taking better pictures since screen is much easier to grab. The quality of the images is even better and though on paper it's been downsized to 12megapixel instead of 16mp..it actually looks a whole lot better now. Also the video is very clear, supposing you're shooting trees in a moving car, the backdrop is sharper and the sky looks utterly beautiful. iPhone is no match in the camera department, samsung is running away with it. I still maintain the note 5 had a brilliant camera.5) Added functionality with SD card storage makes this phone a winner6) It is water proof. Im scared to try it but its good to know I don't have to sulk when I accidentally drop beer on my phone or run home when its raining or not use it if Im out swimming or in the shower. BIG PLUSCONS -1) It seems noticeably heavy even though I am coming from the Note 5. Maybe because it is smaller and thicker. but this is something i can get used to.2) Also you'll need a case because these phones are slippery and too beautiful. My note 5 has a crack on its back so I'm not taking chances with S7.3) The front facing camera on these phones are good but I prefer the iPhone 6s camera for selfies.4) Samsung doesn't come close to iPhone when it comes to sending emails with inbuilt email management system. Often times my emails are in outbox as people are asking me where is my reply to their email. Embarrassing problem.5) the browser is good but it doesn't compare to the speed and readability of Safari...Conclusion - After just a day or two of use, I am going to give the phone a 9/10Verdict - Buy this over any other phone. But definitely get a case."

IT SEEMS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. WHICH CONCLUDES THAT THEY ARE SELLING US USED PHONES, JUST GIFT WRAPPED FOR LIL BIT CHEAPER. DONT BUT IT. ITS A SCAM."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 28, 2017",1.0,If you're like me and have very large fingers then this makes ...,"I bought one of these a year ago, and never have I regretted a phone purchase so badly.To start with the part that will bother most people, the keyboard on my phone is extremely laggy, as in I will type about two words before one shows up. If you're like me and have very large fingers then this makes typing quite frustrating.More annoyingly to me, and perhaps to some others as well, is the level of bloatware installed on this phone and Samsung's awful attitude regarding any expressed desire from a user to have it removed. This becomes a problem at its worst when many of these bloatware apps have background processes that prevent you from getting the best battery life you could out of the phone, entirely so software you don't want can waste resources.Getting to the battery, the life was excellent for one month and then it went downhill rapidly. Now I carry a charging cable with me to work so I can plug the phone in when it inevitably gets low on power around lunch time. Considering it sits by my desk largely unused, this is inexcusable. As someone who likes to go for long hikes I want something that I can trust to hold a charge all day so I can take pictures while I'm out, instead I get something that requires me to carry a portable power pack.Lastly, there's a bizarre phenomenon I can only describe as phantom touch, where my finger gets near a part of the screen and it reacts as though I touched it. Once again, I have large fingers that make precision with a touch screen difficult and this does nothing to help with that."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 12, 2016",1.0,Product not as described.,"This ""factory unlocked international version""  came with a big sticker on the box saying it needed an American SIM card.(Update: I was lucky — I was able to borrow a US nano-SIM from a friend, make a five-minute phone call to it, and after that the phone does seem to be working so far with my own SIM card.)"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 18, 2017",5.0,This is a great phone,"Build - The S7 has a really premium build with gorilla glass 4 on the front and back with a metal frame holding everything together. On the front you have a fantastic 5.1” amoled display, fingerprint sensor, capacitive buttons, notification light and a 5mp camera. On the back you have the 12mp camera, flash, and heart rate sensor.. On the right side you have the power button with the volume rockers on the left side. On the top you have your sim tray and micro sd slot and on the bottom you have your micro-usb port, speaker, and headphone jack. I wish the headphone jack always on the top but I don't mind since I mainly use Bluetooth headphones anyway.Specs -  android 6.0 snapdragon 820 4gb of ram 12 mp rear cam with OIS, 5mp front cam, 2k amoled display.Software & performance - The phone shipped with 6.0 but samsung promises a 7.0 update is on the way. Being a flagship samsung device you get the full touchwiz experience with things like an always on display, themes, different power saving modes, and samsung pay.Front facing fingerprint reader is not as accurate for me as ones placed on the back. But that could be how I hold the phone. Considering the S7 is rocking the Snapdragon 820, any app I opened, opened quickly and performed well, even 3d intensive games like dead trigger 2. With 4gb I was able to multitask between apps with no problem at all. The screen on the S7 is outstanding. It is easily bright enough to see on sunny days, and being that it is an amoled panel means that it has vibrant colors and deep blacks. This also means that the display only lights up the pixels it needs to use so features like the always on display doesnt use too much battery.Camera - The S7 has a 12mp rear camera with optical image stabilization. While it has less MP than the s6 did It also has a larger sensor so it can take in more light. This allows the camera on the S7 to take amazing pictures during the day or night, capturing a lot of detail and having pretty accurate colors even with HDR+ on.Battery - It has a 3000mah battery. It will get you through a full day with light usage but will require you to top it off if you use your phone a lot but it does include fast charging so you shouldnt have to wait too long for your battery to be charged. Gets warm while charging and during heavy usage."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 28, 2016",1.0,No one moved,"I don't know why it was said that someone moved because I'm still at the current address, I might not have been home at that time but I didn't move."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 13, 2017",1.0,Comes with inconvenient built in ads,"I got mine from my carrier, so it isn't exactly the same. Overall it's a good phone, but it has one major problem. It has built in advertisements that pop up over your screen like facebook messenger pop ups. Originally I could get rid of them by opening and closing, which already pissed me off. As of today they aren't going away even then. I hate this and would rather get a iPhone than deal with this bs again."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 22, 2016",1.0,One Star,Hello no
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 13, 2016",1.0,TERRIBLE SELFIE CAMERA,"I recently received this item through my Verizon store. Everything is great EXCEPT the front camera uses a WIDE ANGLE LENS, which means that all pictures are DISTORTED. All selfies look terrible and distorted from what you actually look like. There is a ""Shape Correction"" software feature within the camera that literally displays text saying ""Correct Distortions in your Face"" but it DOES NOT CHANGE THE DISTORTION at all and does not help fix the problem. I have attached pictures I took with the S7 and have not altered them at all. Look at how ridiculous they are."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 17, 2016",1.0,S7 Camera is not good compared to Samsung S6,"S7 Camera is not good compared to Samsung S6. I still love my Samsung S6 videos and pictures. That's reason I thought of upgrading it, but it was a bad choice. Clarity is much less and the overall picture quality is poor."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 6, 2016",5.0,"Awesome. Made me buy a smartphone. I use it for the GPS, photos and videos.","I got one of these at T-Mobile and this phone is crazy awesome. It has replaced my GPS and camera for most of our hiking.My only criticism is the lack of Adoptable Storage. I really want this feature. Or think I do. 32GB is not enough memory and most of my apps do not transfer to the SD card. I've heard both that Adoptable Storage fixes this and that it doesn't. I couldn't tell you which is correct since I don't have it.But, note this is still a five star review. Why's that? Awesome screen, good battery life, pretty good GPS, fast processor, perfectly sized phone - although hard to grip without a case, which is why I recommend a RhinoShield Crash Guard.I pretty much only care about maps, news and emails, but the voice quality on this phone is outstanding when you get to connect to another HD Voice device.I use AllTrails and PDF Maps (with Tom Harrison maps) for hiking. Both work awesome on this phone. The phone's GPS is definitely not as good as my dedicated Garmin eTrex 30 GPS, but it is probably better than my original black and white eTrex Vista and definitely better than my Nuvi 3490. The battery drains fast while I'm recording a track with the phone, but it has had more than enough juice for 12 mile hikes. You must record tracks if you want the GPS to be useful while hiking as getting a fix at the application takes too long if you aren't recording the track. Heavily forested areas cause grief for the phone's GPS whereas my eTrex 30 has no problem at all. The eTrex 30 will also last more than 24 hours while recording everything. However, the phone utterly blows away the eTrex 30 for map quality - and yes, I bought TOPO maps for the eTrex 30. I mean, if I know I'm not going to be in a heavily forested area, and that I'm not going to be out all day, then I always prefer this phone over the eTrex 30. The maps are that much better and the phone's display obviously trounces the eTrex 30's display. And the phone is waterproof just like the eTrex 30!My Canon PowerShot S120 is very obviously the better camera... for still shots. You can see the difference right away if you have an eye for this stuff. I think the phone's main problem is image processing more than the actual sensor. The other thing is there is no optical zoom on the phone obviously. However, the phone does have optical image stabilization and it is pretty good. In a twist, the phone is light years ahead of the S120 for video. I shoot in UHD 30fps (not the default) and the video is amazing. The file size, though, does get to be enormous. Better have a high capacity SD card in there if you do a lot of video with UHD. All this said, the still shots with the phone are very good and are probably better than a lot of lower priced point and shoot cameras. So, when I'm not on vacation or doing something that I really want to get the best shots with, I prefer the phone since it is small and easy to carry. Well, I always have the thing on me, don't I?I had resisted getting a smartphone, because the data costs weren't worth it to me. I do not care about social media, texting, or any of that garbage. I do care a lot about maps, photos and videos since I like to do things in real life. This is the first smartphone that really fit the bill for all of this. It's like it was made just for me. It just needs Adoptable Storage. Please, Samsung/T-Mobile, enable that in an update."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 9, 2016",5.0,Best Galaxy yet.,"To start, I am definitely not an expert in electronics or computers, but being a millennial I can say a few things I like about this phone. I traded in my S6 edge on Verizon's network and got the regular old, flat screen S7. Why? Because my edge had a green line running along the right edge of the phone. It was also hard to type while laying down because my palm reached over and hit keys I didn't want to. I've heard they fixed that on the new edge and note 7. However, I was sick of it and decided I didn't want it on my new phone. I love the fact that it now accepts a memory card. I bought the Samsung brand 128 gb card to hold all of my music, I haven't filled it, but seeing as how all my songs wouldn't fit on my s4 or s6, this is definitely an improvement. The water proof feature is nice. I work for public works in the Pacific Northwest. It is wet up here, and I don't have to worry about my phone. So far I have no complaints at all. It is definitely better than the s6. You can tell they took their time designing this one, and they did a good job. PLUS!!!! The rounded back makes it really comfortable to hold."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 3, 2017",4.0,Great phone. A few things to consider if accustomed to US phones,"We bought this for use with a prepaid plan in the US.  It works more or less as good as you would expect. The camera is great as are most features.If you are buying this for use in the US please note that this is an international version of the phone. As far as I can tell there are only a few areas in which this matters. First it came with a USB to micro USB cable with an enormous travel adapter that clearly wasn't meant for US outlets. It will fit in US outlets, but rather loose. If you stick in a wall outlet it just falls out. It does work better if you stick it in a surge protector lying flat on the floor, since that way it won't fall out.  The second difference between all US version of phones I have experience with is that there is no dedicated slot for the micro SD card. Instead, you have to stick the micro SD card in one of the SIM card slots. It works, but feels less convenient than having the SD card slot on the side of the device."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 3, 2017",1.0,DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG if you want good Support and fair treatment,"I bought new Samsung S7 and after 2 months the mic stop working, I called Samsung and they made me mail them my phone to Texas because they do not have office in my State. After 11 days I received my phone and it was working fine. I was surprise to see  the Service Repair Statement, thy changed 4 parts1- Audio-Receiver part2- Incell Battery Pack3- Assy VT Camera-5m4- Assy Speaker Moule_SMWhat happen I sent my NEW PHONE to fix the mic and got 4 parts changed.When I looked at my phone frame it was damaged from the corner where technician insert the screw driver to take the digitize out. I got mad and called Samsung support to complain. In the beginning Samsung Support tried to tell me that my phone was damaged before!!!!! my phone was NEW and with its original plastic cover when I send it to them and was very clean.Anyway at the end they told me to send the phone back to them to replace the frame, i mailed the phone and it came back to me after 11 days. Guess what, nothing was changed and the Service Repair Statement say they did test on my phone and updated the software!!!!I sent email to Samsung managers on 'Officeofpresident@sea.samsung.com'; 'president@sta.samsung.com' explaining what happen and seeking help. I was contacted by on of their managers and after listening to my problem she told me Samsung will send you a new phone to replace your phone. I was happy but not for long, after few minutes I received email from support to cancel the replacement offer. I sent couple of emails after that and I was ignored.I believe Samsung did not hear about “Customer Satisfaction”DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG if you want good Support and fair treatment"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 20, 2016",4.0,Messed up a good thing.,"The phone functions well after 2 weeks of owning it. I dinged it a star for two reasons. 1. There is not a built-in setting to change how long the home keys stay lit. I had to download an app to change that. 2. The edges of the screen are curved. This is a huge design flaw. I prefer the glass screen protectors over the plastic film. The curve of the edges prevents me from having a screen that goes from edge to edge. It can only go on the flat part of the screen. That doesn't work for me, so I now have an unprotected screen. I like to keep good cases (Speck) and hardened glass screen protectors on my phones so that when I hand them down to my kids after a year or two, they are still operable and in great condition. Samsung already has the Edge, so why not just leave the screen on the flat phone actually flat. Bad decision, Samsung. I may have to go back to LG."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 6, 2017",1.0,"If you get water on your ""waterproof"" phone you better pray.","I got a brand new Samsung Galaxy S7 less than two weeks ago. The phone was nice, responsive, with a great camera. It's flashy but not well made. Samsung claims it's waterproof to 10+ ft for up to 30 minutes. I briefly put it 3 inches underwater for 30 seconds and somehow water seeped into the phone and now it's bricked. Samsung makes wonderful claims about being waterproof, but they refused to replace or repair any water damage. Look at their warranty, they will not cover water damage of any kind. They basically take no responsibility for their manufacturing quality. It's not worth the risk in buying this phone."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"November 11, 2016",1.0,It started on FIRE!,"After 5 months of using the Galaxy s7, it started smoking one morning when I plugged it in. I immediately unplugged it for fear of a fire. This is my work phone and sadly Samsung customer service has been terrible. I have been waiting 5 days for a call back about it, and finally today after two other reps told me they would process a refund for me I am told that the only option I have for a replacement phone is to send it in to their service center and wait for a repair or replacement. This process will take about 3 weeks. Given all the problems they have had with their galaxy note 7 I really thought they would offer me something to help keep me as a customer, but nothing. I have owned all 7 versions of the galaxy series phones, a gear vr, 3 Samsung tablets, a gear 2 smartwatch, and 1 note series phone. Apparently this information does not matter to Samsung."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 9, 2017",1.0,S7 poor performance.,"I purchased the S7 G930F about 8 months ago and was really happy with its features and performance. After about 3 or 4 months it started running very warm. It also began to freeze which would some times require rebooting the phone. Within a month or so it was happening a few times daily. I have performed all of the various resets recommended by Samsung, but the freezing continued and the phone progressively got hotter - none of the buttons would work until it completely cooled down.  Finally a week ago it made a loud buzzing sound and got really hot and died. Samsung would not warrant the phone because it is an international version.  So much for their $700 phone of the year. I wonder how many other S7 phones are having the same overheating problems the Note 7 has become known for."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 9, 2017",3.0,The Glass Slipper of Phone Technology....Literally......,"Bought this phone because of it's excellent photo capability.  Over all a very nice phone. I've had it for about a week when I discovered the entire phone is GLASS.  Please be aware that a very short drop onto a rigid hard uneven surface WILL crack the glass back most likely making that 'water resistance' useless.  When I purchased the phone I assumed the case was aluminum as I went with the spun gold version until my son set it down on some rocks during a photo shoot.  We saw him put it down and the 'drop' was less than an inch.  Later he picked the phone up to leave and sure enough, a horizontal crack had appeared.  The glass case made it easier to seal for water resistant however, given the choice...I'd rather have a phone that was good o' fashion rubber, plastic or aluminum then....GLASS and water resistant.  Seriously who makes a cell phone out of glass?! It's got great capabilities but if you have to treat it like a glass slipper, what's the point?"

Yes, overall it's good phone (when you have one that works). The problem with it is the battery. I have been having to constantly plug it in through out the day, and I barely use the phone enough to demand this. I stay on top of closing my apps after using them, and try to keep brightness down. When I look at my battery statistics, the two biggest drainers are usually Android System and Android OS.If you're looking for a slim pretty phone with no ability to even swap out the weak battery, this is your best bet. Also, what's the point of putting a beautiful screen on a phone if you have to keep it at 10% screen brightness the whole time?

I bought this $800 phone on july 25th, 2016- it ""broke"" 15 days later.This phone is a piece of junk, obviously terrible quality control over at samsung- I'm sure some units are fine but many are defective as mine was.This phone is brand new and you can already google the common problem which mine was cursed with, go ahead you'll be amazed. ""samsung S7 edge Black screen"" or Black screen of death they also like to call it.This is the SECOND galaxy which has done this to me with the s5 being the other culprit about 2 years ago.All functions of the phone still work, vibrate, light up, make sounds- but no screen.Samsung DOES NOT stand behind their products. I was given a stiff screw off on my first attempt with the S5 and I didn't even try for the second.Yeah I have insurance, but its still $175 and I get a refurb back, not a new phone. Plus I get all the joys of switching all of my items back over to a new phone and sending in a phone with sensitive data on it which could not be deleted without seeing the screen.I hate apple products, but man, they stand behind their phones when you get a dud."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 17, 2017",4.0,Bands differ in Factory Unlocked Version so be careful,"The one thing to look out for on this G930F Unlocked version is that it doe snot have the new Band 30 that AT&T is using to overlap and provide extra coverage in densely populated markets.I went with the AT&T version (G930A) as it does have both the new Band 29 and 30...In my market AT&T is using Band 30 and it is very fast...SO, my only hope is to Root the AT&T version and remove the AT&T bloat but I am waiting until after the Nougat update hits..Hopefully with the Galaxy S8, the Factory Unlocked will include ALL Bands being used in the US and have a 64 GB model available"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 23, 2016",5.0,"Great phone, ignore the slander.","Got this phone from ATT and not amazon, but thought I should write a little about it so you can ignore the slander comments.This phone is exactly as marketed.Pros:- Its fast, It will run many processes in the background without ever bogging down ( improvement over my S5)- Its got a good camera for the 99% of us who are not professional photographers.- Display is clear and high def.- It's slightly smaller than my S5. I actually like this.- They brought back the SD card slot (one reason I didn't get the S6)- To the fellow that complained about dropping it from over a foot and it breaking..... buy a case... its what people do with a $700 phone.Cons:- Battery life is still good, but not as good as my S5... I will play with it all day and it will still have about 40% left as opposed to 60% with my older one.- Headphone jack on the bottom of phone... personal preference I suppose, but I liked it on the top.- Still has the more complicated menu settings of android phones... Ex: Might take you a few minutes to find the right tab to rename your phone.- Samsungs ""SmartSwitch"" isn't great when transferring files to your new phone. Try to store as much as you can on your old SD card before moving things or you might lose some of those valued pictures or documents."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 28, 2016",5.0,Great Phone That Goes Beyond My Initial High Expectation,"This phone was much better than I expected. The phone battery is long lasting, the screen is beautiful with amazing colors, the camera is impressive (especially in low light), super loud speakers, and the OS has so many features.  The phone feels great in my hand and feels like a quality phone.My only complaints about the phone is the placement of the speaker (easily covered by my hand when holding the phone in landscape) and the App Drawer not automatically rearranging the apps when uninstalling/removing an old app (TouchWiz issue). This is minor issues compared to my enjoyment of the phone."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 16, 2016",4.0,"Great for traveling, and offers great performance all around.",Great performance offered by Samsung's Exynos octa core chip. Top of the line specifications in international version. Not localized but for global market. You will not get volte nor video chat which are features offered by carriers. Warranty not included for international version if you live in country other than the phones country. Otherwise this unlocked model is great for traveling and used for playing purposes...
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 6, 2017",2.0,No more Samsung,"Worst galaxy after the S6. Screen freezes from time to time, it's very slow, takes several minutes to open the camera app for example, can't really switch between apps because of lack of performance, battery don't last even half a day when one use the phone, without using it last maybe one day (12 not 24 hours). The only positive things are a memory card slot, waterproof and nice design. After several years of buying Samsung phones I will definitely switch to another brand!"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 11, 2016",3.0,I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge because I thought it would be the best of the few that I was offered,"Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge is without question the most gorgeous cell phone out.  But that is as far as it goes in my opinion.  After all, smartphones are mostly about functionality.  Face it, these are handheld computers.  Many if not most of us have come to depend on our smartphone to live our personal lives by.  My brother has always had the most current Galaxy phone and im not sure if he's ever tried anything else.  I am a retired AT&T service rep and for 29 yrs, phones were my business.  I have used Motorola and HTC but mostly LG.  I had a problem with my latest LG G4 overheating and not holding charge.  It was replaced 4 times and eventually AT&T agreed to replace it with a different model.  I was left with a few choices, since it was a warranty replacement, none of them being an LG phone. I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge because I thought it would be the best of the few that I was offered.  I HATE IT!!  I have felt for a while that Samsung, being super rich and powerful in the cell phone arena, has stacked the reviews against LG.  There is literally no comparison in these phones.  LG G series and V series phones are far above Samsung in a number of ways.  LG phones work much more proficiently.  Their menus are much more organized and have many more options to customize and personalize your phone.  I do not believe I will adjust to the Galaxy S7 and learn to like it because it is sluggish with lots of stuff in it but functioning often with no rhyme nor reason.  One important app that I used on LG phones to make custom personalized ringtones and notification tones will not work on the S7 Edge.  The music player is cumbersome and got too much junk that I don't like or want.  I will have to deal with this phone for at least 6 months of the remaining contract  before I can get another LG phone.  I have no beef or personal vendetta against Samsung but this is just my most honest and sincere experience with these phones."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 21, 2017",5.0,Great Product,"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is the best phone I have ever had. After buying a Samsung, I will never go away. They definitely just gained a loyal customer. The camera is remarkable. The auto focus is spot on every time. I can be moving my phone and the camera will still pick up the objects. The clarity of the camera is something short of astounding. It is so good, I can zoom in and see pores on an individual’s face. The zoom capabilities are also phenomenal. Even at full zoom, the camera still is clear. The battery is also a highlight of this phone. I can be on it all day and still end up with 13% battery at 10:00 p.m. Another cool feature is the power saving mode. There is a mode where it will allow you to go days on just a single charge. I have had no issues with speed. The processing has been smooth and hasn’t had any glitches or bogs. As long as the internet connection is good, there is no buffering online. Games are fast, videos don’t buffer, and calls don’t drop. Having a waterproof phone is also a plus. Now, I can play music off my phone while in the shower and still be able to change the song! It also allows for mess ups. How often have you heard of people being pushed in a pool or had their phone fall in a toilet? That isn’t an issue anymore because the phone is rated to be under water for 30 minutes. There are a couple things that I don’t like. I don’t like the low quality pictures that are taken on snap chat. This is Snapchat’s fault, not Samsung’s. I also don’t like the group message. I can only send texts to 10 people at a time. This is inconvenient. Other than that, this phone is superior to all other phones of its generation. When looking at phones, I give this 5 stars. This is a phenomenal product. I would highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a phone. Best of luck on your search!"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 8, 2017",4.0,Get a good case!,"I can't stress how much I love this phone, but there is just one problem that I've ever really had. Because of the phones glass exterior it is quite slippery and this does not bode well with the fragile LCD (the display) and I had to purchase a new phone after I dropped it face first on the concrete. To be fare not many phones will survive a fall like that but just be safe and buy a high quality case.

I sent it back for a warranty replacement and they did find the battery to be ""bad"" and replaced it and are shipping it back... but I shouldn't have to jump through flaming hoops to have a working phone in less than a year of ownership. What sucks is that I can't even replace the battery myself, which would have been preferable!"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 2, 2016",5.0,I think samsung makes great products. My last phone was the samsung galaxy ...,"What can I say.  I think samsung makes great products.  My last phone was the samsung galaxy s4 and it worked fine.  Untill I decided I needed a upgrade.  So I got myself the Galaxy S7.  This phone can do no wrong in my opinion.  The phone comes with a 32gigs of memory and it also has a  slot for a micro memory card, you can decide how much more memory you need for this phone up to 299gb.  The phone comes in a sleek onxy finish.  It is thin and smooth.  The camera is awesome on this phone with a 12 megapixal on the rear, 5 megapixal on the front.  It also has a feature to shoot in low light and the pictures come out aswsome.  The s7 is also water resistant for 30 mins and up to 5 feet of water.  You can also  make your phone unique by using the features to change the background etc.  Other brands you would have to jailbreak the phone to custom it.  The battery is fast charging so if your in a hurry your phone is to and always ready when you are.I do not work for or am I affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product. I always read user reviews when purchasing products, whether online or in a store. I appreciate the effort of those who write comprehensive and detailed reviews and hope that my review has been helpful to you. I am sure if you have any other questions or concerns you can ask them directly in the comment section.  Thank you."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 8, 2016",1.0,Stay away; phone may not make calls,"Worst phone I've ever owned. I'm on my third S7. I've spent hours in the phone store getting help from ""experts"". I've tried calling Samsung. I've replaced the ""defective"" devices with a new ones. I've given up. My S4 worked like a dream, BTW. I never had a complaint. The second I replaced it with the S7, my life became hard. It drops calls all over town and at my home, on or off WiFi calling. People can't hear me. I can't hear people. There is sometimes static. I can't even call for pizza or make a doctor's appointment without either having to call twice (due to call droppage) or having to hear the other person repeatedly say, ""What did you say? You're cutting out..."" I can't replace the stupid thing with another brand because after having nonstop trouble, the window to return it ran out. I now must wait to pay it off in 2 years and suffer through this cruddy nonsense. Or pay even more to activate a home line so I can make phone calls. The S7 (at least based on the 3 I've had in the past couple of months) is utterly worthless for anything other than surfing the Web, using apps or watching videos. I will probably never buy from Samsung again after this expensive experience, and until now, I've been a loyal Samsung fan! This phone completely disappoints. If you can't make a clear 5-minute phone call from a nearly perfect call-reception area, you really shouldn't call the device a ""phone."" It is nothing more than a small tablet. Save your money."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 27, 2017",3.0,Great phone with reception issues,"I used it over a year and it is a great phone with few issues. I believe people use cellular phones mostly for data and very little for voice calls! I will not bother why it is a great phone since you have plenty of reviews covering it. But here is why I gave it 3 stars. My wife uses an iPhone and I use S7. We both have T-mobile as the carrier. At home, I can only use my phone for voice calls in one tiny spot with poor sound quality and most of the time other parties will not hear me. My wife's iPhone works perfectly everywhere at home... In my opinion, it is the quality of the antenna (actually the lack of it) causing this reception issue. We are using the same carrier, the same cell tower, and staying at the same location and I cannot have decent voice call. A phone with that price is supposed to provide you with acceptable call quality comparable to iPhone. S7 will not give you that."

Best phone by far... hands down"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 22, 2016",5.0,Impressed by the new galaxy s7 😀,Even though is advertised as being water resistant and not waterproof it seems like it could be; because of ip rating and well I went swimming and used it under water for almost 2 hours I had no troubles with it damaging any of internal ports or components of the phone. I suggest if you going to buy the phone make sure to go to settings and go to the application manager and go to the battery and click on details there will be a option to save battery on every application you use if you don't you're going suffer alot of drainage in battery because sometimes apps stay in the background taking up all the ram and draining the battery life. One last thing for the us models it has a Sony camera sensor and a Qualcomm snapdragon processor and for other countries outside of the us it uses a Samsung exynos processor and a Samsung oiscell camera sensor. You also might want to buy a really good case because the phone is made of a glass back and aluminum alloy side and bottoms.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 27, 2017",5.0,Great phone!,"Amazing phone, been having it for a year and still works like new. Something I love is that I've dropped it several times and it barely even has any scratches on it and the screen looks like new."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 25, 2016",5.0,Excellent smartphone with 4GB of ram,"The Samsung Galaxy S7,Where do I start. Excellent smartphone with 4GB of ram, sleek and slim metal body, 12-mp camera (excellent in low light), 32GB storage and a Quad HD display. This stunning device is worth the price. The Samsung Galaxy S7 is not just another regular smartphone, it is a powerful gaming machine. With the new Mali-T880 MP12 GPU, console-type games can run without any lag on the device without draining the battery. I forgot to mention the 3000mAh battery which is a big step up from the S6's battery. The Galaxy S7 is much more power efficient than the S6 and the battery can last a long time with the Ultra Power Saving Mode. It is also full ip68 waterproof meaning that it can be underwater 1.5m depth for 30-minutes and come out perfect. Unlike the Galaxy S6, the S7 has expandable storage. You can insert a micro-sd card up with a maximum of 200gb of capacity. That will solve the problem that everyone has, the problem of low storage available.  The Galaxy s& is recommended to all those people out there who want a quality smartphone with a powerful processor, a stunning QHD display, and overall the very best smartphone."

It is beautiful, it is ""edgey,"" and it is FAST!. Although I love the curves and the way it feels in my hand, it did attract fingerprints, so I placed a Skinomi screen cover (great cover, BTW, and easy to install) AND a cover (currently using Samsung clear black S view case) to limit fingerprints and prevent damage to this gorgeous phone. Can't believe how long it lasts on 1 battery charge. I am currently using Samsung stand fast charger, and I've got to say, it is really speedy! At night, I place it on my Tylt Vu, and it charges while I sleep, then shuts off so no overcharge. The phone is lightning fast and handles everything I've thrown at it. I LOVE the availability of THEMES, many of which are free, and the remainder are really inexpensive--nice way to personalize the phone! This was an upgrade from a Galaxy S5--I skipped the S6--love the S7E return to additional storage via micro SD card (up to 200 GB!) and water-resistance. Thought I'd miss the replaceable battery the S% had, but this battery is a BEAST and haven't missed replaceable at all. The Edge is a nice feature--still learning how to best utilize it.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 9, 2016",5.0,"Just got it, and I love it","I preordered this phone through Verizon wireless website and it came ahead of schedule on March 8. By ordering through a carrier the price was a few hundred dollars cheaper than what the unlocked version costs on amazon. Out of the box you get the phone itself, a charging cable, headphone earbuds, a usb connector (to connect 2 phones together), and a tool to open the sd card tray. Its easy to not see the small metal sd card tray tool, so be careful. I am switching from a Samsung S4 and the quality of this phones build is noticable. The S4 was made of plastic and felt cheap, the S7 is glass front, glass back and metal sides and feels sleeker and sturdier. I was concerned that the back was made of glass but the guy at the verizon store says they get very few complaints of the back shattering. I rarely drop my phone so I'm not worried. You can insert a removable SD card into a tray at the top of the device. you stick the SD card tool into a little hole at the top and a tray pops out. If you pull the entire tray out the SIM card can fall out so be careful. This phone is physically bigger than my S4 (length) but slightly thinner.Setup was a breeze although it took some time. I had to log into verizonwireless website find the right links and activate the phone from the website. If you by from a physical location they will set it up for you. Most of my apps, pics, and settings transferred over automatically.There is a fingerprint scanner in the home screen button, but you can choose other security options like pattern or pin if you so choose. Speakers are on the bottom near the usb input and headphone jack, so that means if phone is lying face up you can still hear from the speakers (S4 speakers were on back which meant sound could get muffled when laying the phone down or if hand is covering back). not a fan of headphone jack on bottom but thats a minor annoyance. Screen is bright and looks great. Camera is fewer MP than the S6 but this camera supposedly lets in more light. All the pictures I took look great.The phone moves very fast. There is no lag opening apps. For all of you who are dropping your phones in the toilet or in your beer, this phone is waterproof! SAMSUNG PAY! So this was a surprise to me, Samsung Pay is awesome. The Galaxy S7 supports MST which simulates the magnetic stripe on your credit card which means you can use Samsung Pay anywhere that has a credit card machine. This is better than Android pay and Apple Pay which use NFC and can only be used at a small number of retailers.So first annoying thing I noticed was Verizon and Samsung put a bunch of their own apps on the phone. I was confused on how I should be sending text messages because there was a Google, Verizon and samsung messaging app! I just want one app to text, I dont need 3. Also the phone gets noticeably warm with use. i'm guessing this may partially be due to the fact that it has been downloading pics, contacts, apps and everything from the cloud. This is a bit surprising to me since this phone is supposed to have liquid cooling. If I were playing a game on the phone it would probably get pretty hot.So Pro/Con time:Pros:WaterproofRemovable Storage (phones without this just try to charge you more for storage, its cheap to buy SD cards)Camera (lower MP, but it lets in more light, pics look noticeably better)Bigger battery (longer battery life and fast charging, also able to charge wireless)Faster (no lag opening apps, browsing web is fast)Android MarshmallowCons:Bloatware (came pre loaded with 7 samsung apps, 8 verizon apps, not to mention 10 google apps but i actually use the google ones)Glass back attracts fingerprintsNo USB type C - small annoyance. Things are moving to type C and its nice that C fits both ways, but at same time micro USB is ubiquitous so I can use 1000 different micro USB chargers I have lying aroundCrashes - So far the phone has crashed at least once per day. and the fingerprint sensor has stopped working a few timesSHOULD YOU BUY?If you have S4 or older - This is a no brainer upgrade right awayIf you have an S5 - I would upgrade. They brought back the waterproof, you have the removable SD card slot, bigger processor bigger batteryIf you have the S6 - I probably wouldn't upgrade. Yes they brought back features that weren't on the S6 but I'm not sure that's worth spending the money to upgrade from the S6 after only a year. S6 is still a good phone.Wait for LG G5? - This is an interesting debate. The G5 has more unique features like modular accessories to add to bottom of the phone. LG ditched the leather customizable back for an all aluminum body so its now closer to Iphone in styling. The G5 does not have wireless charging or samsung pay (just android pay). Its really a toss up on which of these two you should get"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 1, 2016",2.0,Back To iPhone,"Always debate of iOS and Android with my friends, i decided to switch to S7 but its still look like s6, not good battery like iphone 6, Getting slow after months, Must have reset setting in one month for speed. very disappointed. Just Cameras are awesom"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 8, 2016",1.0,Beware of faulty phone coupled with Samsung's bad customer service,"There is a possibility of getting a faulty phone, no matter what brand you use. But even if you bring your faulty S7 to the customer service of its originating country, Samsung WILL NOT do an exchange. Even though I bought it just a week ago. They'll simply do a factory reset, essentially wiping out the time you spent personalizing this phone. I had been using Samsung for years but I am definitely switching to Apple in the future. S7 burned such a big hole in my pocket that I just have to bear with a slow, constantly self-restarting, messed up mobile for now. Customer service is very important these days, so I am never buying anything from Samsung again."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 20, 2016",5.0,Great!  Love the camera especially.,"Echoing lots of other reviews, the phone is fast and responsive, the battery life is great, the screen is gorgeous, and overall functionality is great with the latest version of Android.I would say this phone is the maximum screen size for one-handed use.  With small hands, I was pressing the touch sensitive buttons to the left and right of the home button all the time.  I purchased a cheap case to provide a lip for my hand to rest which solves that problem.One thing that I LOVE is the camera.  This thing shoots in 4K video, and the image quality is far beyond any other phone.  It lets you adjust iso, shutter speed, and exposure which are features usually found in DSLR cameras.Here is a sample video I took using the Galaxy S7: [...]"

The text function DOES NOT WORK. Its like you're drunk texting even when you're sober. And the internet search function sometimes works, if it feels like it, though probably not because this is an idiot phone for idiots.

I have used a Moto G (3rd gen) and that phone's software is far superior to that on the S7. Using this phone is death by a thousand cuts --- everywhere there could be elegance, there is clumsiness. Why doesn't ""do not disturb"" mode have a user-defined time limit? (I'm at a concert, I want DND for 2 hours, not indefinitely.) Why is it that **every time** I select a contact and then a phone number from the favorites screen, I also have to choose whether this is to be the default or just once? For apps this makes sense, for phone numbers this is just thoughtless user interface design. Why is there no easy way to tell the phone to use the SD Card for apps? I have to go the application manager, and then for each app, click on the app, click on storage, and only then can I see whether or not the app can be stored on the SD Card. Arrrggh."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 9, 2016",5.0,So far so good!,"So far pretty good! I got this yesterday 3 days early from Sprint and have been using it heavily since. I'm very happy with the functionality, it's fast, UI is great and Android Marshmallow is absolutely amazing.Overall I am very impressed so far and I like it far better than my friend's Galaxy S6 or my dad's S5. I was worried about switching away from HTC because I loved my HTC's metal frame but this is much sturdier than I was expecting and feels very solid in your hand. The UI's have their differences (TouchWiz vs HTC Sense) but overall quite similar and not too difficult to transition.The ""Always On"" display is a very simple but amazing feature and bringing back water resistance and expandable memory is what made me switch to the GS7. Fingerprint reader is better than any other phone one I've used and extremely quick. Photos (front and rear camera) come out clean and the shutter is very quick. Have yet to test it in low light but I will be updating this review with more information when I get to testing more features. Being able to split screen apps is quite wonderful and I'm using it more than I would have expected myself to. I got home last night after using it down to about 40% battery life and plugging into the normal MicroUSB charger it went from 40%-70% in about 30 minutes so it does charge very quickly. I have yet to get a wireless QI charger yet but plan to soon.My only gripe so far is battery life. I typically use my phone somewhat heavily and I took it off the charger this morning at 8am. It is now 2pm and I'm at 56%. It's not quite as good as I was expecting but I'm sure as I manage it more and get my task killer apps installed but when I'm getting barely more than the 2 year old HTC One M8 I traded in for this I guess I was somewhat shocked.All in all I'm very happy so far. I'll update this review as I keep using it more and more and I'm sure battery life will increase as I manage the apps and stop playing with it as often as I have been (pretty much non stop for the last 16 hours)."

But I am giving only 2 stars.  No matter what, this phone always uses data unless your data is already turned off before you turn on your phone. (not waking from sleep mode, you literally reboot the phone) So, if your phone is turned on and is on 4G meaning using Data and you find Wi Fi at the Airport or a Coffee shop or at Home you connect to that Wi-Fi then it still uses data. So, after connecting to Wi Fi I turned off data, I still see the 4G symbol and it still uses Data. I tested this several times and this is the result. Then the only way to use Wi Fi is to turn the phone off complete and turn it back on (reboot)."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 5, 2016",5.0,Samsung is back at its PRIME...,"I got one of these bad boys earlier. So here's my input on it.The Samsung Galaxy S7 is an amazing piece of technology. Samsung stuck with the glossy, glassy design, while bringing back the stuff we loved. Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SD card EXPANSION/ This was a huge difference from Apples and Galaxies. So why on Earth did they ditch storage expansion, I don’t know. But it’s back! Not only that, but it fits well with the SIM card. Another thing they brought back to the S7, waterproof! Admittedly, the S6 was really good against water, but it’s nice to know the S7 can official survive and a few meters of water. The phone is faster than ever, and Android Marshmallow is so clean. They improved TouchWiz UI; now it’s not that ugly lime and blue color. The phone in the hand is comfortable, unlike the sharp edges of the S6 and S6 edge. Camera is very responsive and takes the best low light photos I’ve ever seen. The 12 Megapixel camera, seems low in terms as pixels, but uses an amazing technology called Dual Pixel Autofocus. Overall:Pros:-Better Battery Life (3000 mAh)-Faster (Exynos 8890)-Great Camera (12 MP)-Storage Expansion-WaterproofCons:-Slippery in handsIn conclusion, if you like the S6’s design and wished it had more “Android” features, this is the perfect phone. Samsung improved on everything and Galaxy lovers can’t be happier. Samsung listened to it’s audience and did everything right! If you’re coming from an Apple device, no time would be better to switch!"

My only problem is the the edges are not slightly raised to protect the screen from SOME scratches like my previous S5 was. Was at work today and whilst walking back to the break room I pulled it from my back pocket and dropped it. Slid screen down (waiting for my case to get to my house from Amazon) for a couple feet and didn't notice any scratches until I was outside and the sun reflected, showing me 5 long but very slight scratches on the screen. Not happy but it's just my fault as well as the manufacturer for bending to peoples wants for a better feeling in their hands. Otherwise it's wonderful!  EDIT: There is a UI problem with this phone that isn't fixed yet, but there is a simple solution to it. If you find that your power button does not work as well as your volume down button... Just hold the power and volume down button until it turns off and restarts, then it'll be fine. Happened twice the last couple days. Annoying, I know, but it should be fixed in a little while.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 6, 2016",4.0,Honest Review. Awsome Phone With Few Issues.,"I preordered the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge from T-Mobile on the 23rd. I received it on the March 1st, ahead of the official launch. As soon as it came in, I put my old phone down (Samsung Note Edge) and started using my new gadget.Right out of the box, the first think I notices was how thin it was. The camera bump is almost non existent. It may also be worth mentioning I got the Titanium Silver, although it has a sort of gold tint to it. The body feels solid and very well built. The four buttons (Home, Power, volume up and down) are well fitting and there is little wiggling.What we don't see is the dust and water resistant properties, and frankly, I do not want to test it out.The speaker, voice hole, power/usb port. and headphone jack are all on the bottom of the phone. At the top is another microphone hole, and the sim card/storage card slot.This is preference, but I dislike having my earphone jacks on the bottom of the phone. Also, the major selling point of this phone, the edge's, are all but lost in the sleek design. Unlike the Note Edge, the edge just seems too narrow and thin, making it more of a visual appeal rather than an actual useful tool. The Note Edge had a sharper slop and large edge screen for actual apps, short cuts, ect. For the S7 Edge, you have to bring out the modified ""edge screen"", and honestly, even the S7 non-edge can do same thing. Overall, getting the S7 Edge over the S7 non-edge is just the size of the screen.The Home button has a finger scanner in it, so when you register a passcode, you can assign your finger print as well to unlock faster. So far it works very well.The camera quality is excellent. The best I have seen on a phone. This comparing to the Note Edge's 16MP and Moto Pure's 21MP. MP now are more for numbers and touting, but S7 Edge proves that a ""lower"" MP count of 12 can surpass the quality of higher MP cameras. The pictures in low light, action shots, close ups, bright lights, ect are fast and accurate. I have yet to encounter much blur. This is a huge leap from the past Samsung cameras that have been plagued with zooming and focusing issues.The OS. With the power behind this phone, and 4 GB of ram, this thing flies. I spent so time removing the bloatware that Samsung packs on it. The enhanced edge menu is not as good as the standard Note Edge's menu. Unfortunately, either the phone hardware or the Marshmallow Android operating system is having some issues.Apps on the phone work good about 80% of the time. The other 20% I have had issues with the app just closing all together. This is probably due to the ""newish"" Android OS that comes installed, so hopefully it gets patched soon.The screen is extra sensitive, even after calibration. I scroll, and am very careful not to move my finger too fast or double tap, but the phone 30-40% of the time registers it as a tap. Also, wifi cuts in and out. I have switched routers, reset phone, ect, but the wifi drops a few times an hour. Mostly when the phone screen turns off.The screen picture is beautiful. can't say much more than that. Can't wait to try with the Gear VR.Finally, call quality. For me, the speaker is not very loud, both on speaker phone mode and off. Sound on the other end of the call seems adequate, so no complaints there.In summary, the phone is pretty dang good. The now useless edge screen, wifi issues, screen sensitivity issues, and app issues are the reasons why the phone does not get a perfect score."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 9, 2016",1.0,No synchronization with Outlook -- who needs it?,"DO NOT buy this phone if you want to be able to synchronize your calendar and contacts from your computer.  After 2 hours being bounced around among AT&T, Samsung, and Microsoft (not to mention the hours I spent trying on my own to synchronize my Outlook data with the phone), the answer, apparently, is that it is a ""known issue"" that a Galaxy S7 cannot be synchronized with Outlook.  Seriously.What it will do, instead of synchronizing, is duplicate entries between the computer and the phone.  So, if you had a haircut set for Wednesday, synchronized that with Outlook today, then moved that appointment to Friday on your Outlook calendar on the computer, guess what?  Next time you synchronize, your Galaxy S7 and Outlook will show haircut appointments on Wednesday AND Friday.It gets worse.  If you didn't move the appointment, after synchronizing, you will show two identical entries for that haircut on Wednesday.So, basically, you can't use this phone for calendar and contacts.  Or, at least, that's the answer after 2 hours of having the technical support people remotely control the phone."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 11, 2016",1.0,Malfunction/flimsy,"Flimsy as hell.  Screen malfunctioned after the user had it for 14 days.  It was never dropped.  After the user tried navigating through the phone with the help of google and verizon, the back of the screen cracked a bit.  A phone should be way more durable then that.  Doesn't even have to be titanium allow mixture, just not a flimsy plastic that cracks easily to keep us from returning the phone.  DON'T BUY."

They make those great phones, that almost can serve you dinner, but they are getting bigger and bigger.... Am I the only one who still hope for a good, up to date device that would fit again in my pocket?"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 8, 2016",2.0,... from Costco and had to return them due to bad battery life,"I purchased 2 of these from Costco and had to return them due to bad battery life.  I was lucky to get 6 hours out of them before I had to recharge.Having said that, I will say they were very good in the bright sunlight and the processor was faster than my S4 but I still opted to go back to my S4 due to the battery lasting all day.  I could just set the S7 on my desk and watch the battery power drain out of it without even using it.  I also tried the power saving mode with no noticeable difference.  The phones also generated a lot of heat which I assume was causing the battery drain.  Costco did give two extra large batteries for the phones as if they knew there was a power drain problem.  Costco/Verizon was very good at returning them.  I would probably upgrade to the S7 if the battery life can be solved.  For now I will stick with my old S4 which functions just fine."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 4, 2016",1.0,Get an IPhone,"This phone is a joke. It doesn't work much of the time and I've wondered if I can live with this, I can maybe live without a phone at all. It can't keep internet connection for anything, especially wi-fi. The speaker works 5% of the time so I have to type my texts. The keys are so sensitive, stuff gets deleted if you even go near the phone and I have all the settings off that allow you to do stuff without touching it. The Google calendar doesn't save events when you create them so you miss appointments. There are a million other small things I can't believe are so stupid. Just get an I-Phone. I thought it would be better but it is by far worse than an IPhone. I dropped it in water for a split second and it's not working now. Great! So much for water resistant to dunks as their description says."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 29, 2016",1.0,"Easily breakable, difficult to repair.","Avoid like the plague. The first time the phone landed on a hardwood floor from 2 ft. or so height the back of the phone cracked. Very not durable. Apparently not easily repairable either. Of course Samsung is not going to replace or repair it. I owned other phones before (iPhone, Moto X), they fell on the floor multiple times, none of them got damaged.The glass back is nonsense. It might look nice, but who cares how it looks if it will be either broken or covered by a protective case?Other thoughts: The power and volume down buttons stopped working right away. Apparently there is a workaround to make them work. Still not acceptable for a flagship phone. The Samsung Smart Switch software is a garbage - it didn't work at all (the other phone is Moto X 2nd gen with Lollipop, so well above advertised 4.0/4.3)."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 23, 2016",1.0,Galaxy S7 Bluetooth does not find car's Bluetooth signal.,"I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 through my T-Mobile store (not via Amazon.)  However, my 1-star rating is based on the fact that the S7's Bluetooth cannot even find my car's Bluetooth signal. It worked fine with my Galaxy S4, but not with the S7."
