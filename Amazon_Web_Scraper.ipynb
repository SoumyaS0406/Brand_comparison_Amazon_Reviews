      "[\"First off...I have had many Blu phones over the years.I must say this one seems to be the best , so far.The phone setup was all good, loaded my usual apps, and it runs very smooth.Although the screen is a lower resolution, the colors and sharpness are more than  good enough, for my needs.Netfix played fine, external speaker was plenty loud for my needs. Sound itself, is not too tinny, and has a little richness to it.Music as well, was pretty decent sounding.Managed to pair the phone with my car without issue.All in all, pretty good phone for the money.Still need to play around with the camera a little, but so far I'm pleased with the results.Please note for those mentioning the lack of quick settings(BT, brightness, flashlight, etc) you need to pull up from the bottom of the screen, to access those.No regrets in this purchase, I would buy it again.Edit....to the person who said it doesn't have face unlock, you have to set up smart Lock, to access that feature.So no, I don't believe they actually lied.Edit #2..I uploaded a few pics, pretty nice.Edit #3 in reading through the reviews, I noticed a few, that really don't represent the device in general.1- a user dropped the phone and it broke, which is not a reasonable review.2-a user stated the front flash was not opreating, which Amazon will send a replacement for, and these things happen with many phone manufacturers.3-Another person called Blu (liers) because they said there was no face unlock, however it's there in the settings.I brought theses up because they effect the people's opinions of a product, they are intending to purchase.And didn't think they were a fair assessment of the device.Edit #4After using the phone at home and at work, my initial impression still stands.I wanted to add another bump to the phone.Some have mentioned the audio being good, and I would agree, but what I really appreciated ,was that it's loud and clear enough, while driving my work truck, to be able to hear my navigation dictating directions.Even some of my other phones from OnePlus, LG, and a few others, didn't do as well, in this area.\", 'I try to get out but they pull me right back in.In our home we have used Blu mobile phones for some years now. Often slow on the updates but consistent quality. For starters the finger print scanner is crazy fast. The face recognition also works fine \"regardless to what others have said\".  The screen is bright and crisp. Do i expect the OS to get an upgrade.. Probably not, Blu has often been very slow with the OS updates if they update it at all.  At this price point i don\\'t mind getting a newer Blu mobile every year or two.Pros:Big bright screen.Multiple security options ie. Face, finger print, passwords and patterns.Charges quickly and the battery lasts.Audio is clear.Cons:The option try comes up from the bottom.It came with a case that is feeling more like thin plastic then a thicker gel case.The biggest con for me right now is the lack of case optionsWhy still a five star rating? Anything that is really a con right now is just personal preference and doesn\\'t bring down the rating at all.Please though, Really. Someone out there make some cases, Hard Shell with inner rubber lining, Gel case to replace the supplied case.  Dang i would even go with something that flips over the screen like the old Blu Life One Xs had.Im sure i will check in daily to try to spot a case.', \"I bought this phone to add my 2 SIM Cards when traveling outside the country in order to avoid carrying 2 phones from AT&T and T-Mobile. Everything is this phone is almost perfect! (My carrier phones are LG G6 and LG V30), and this phone has almost everything that I have on my flagship devices, even more!- Sound with headphones is MUCH better than LG's thanks to it MaxxAudio Chip that brings an excellent audio experience (Wired, Wireless and Phone Speaker)- Selfie Camera: Definitively beat the LG's, the only advise is to install Camera Zoom Pro ($1.99 in Google Play), it will take perfect photos for main and selfie cameras since the native camera software won't do a good job for the camera set.- Battery: A heavy daily use with no compromise. It will be enough for a full day of use.- Screen: Despite the specs, it is as good as the LG V30 in the same format 18:9- Security and Fingerprint Scanner: As good as any other flagship phone, fast and reliable.- Design: Beautiful, you can't notice if you have the One Plus 5T or a BLU phone ;)- Internal Memory, RAM and Processor speed: At the level of my LG V30!- Phone comes with a very cool case, pre-applied screen protector and great fast charger.Some improvements needed:- No WiFi Calling: Please BLU, work on this and implement it in coming software releases! (It would make a true flagship phone)- MicroUSB charging port: C'mon! It's 2018! (It should be now USB Type C)- Business eMail App like Samsung, LG, Apple, etc.- Maybe an IP-67 or 68 for next devices? (that would make it perfect!)\", 'Great phone for the price.You get everything a high-end phone have for 1/3 of the cost.My personal phone is a s8 plus and my work phone is a lg g6.  I m looking for something for my kid and decided to go with a honor 7x which I returned a few weeks ago and this phone here.  Loved the honor 7x but a huge problem was the tether (hotspot) didn\\'t work for my service plan.  This phone is similar to the honor 7x, but have a bigger screen and $50 dollars more.Plus:Big screen4 GB RamGood CameraBattery last longSuper fast finger print sensorNeg:No USB type C - not a huge dealWaterproofNot every app can utilize the full screen.  Watching Netflix and Hulu is like a 5.2\" screen.Surprise at the picture quality,  pretty good for the price.S8 plus, lg G6 and Blu Vivo x', \"This is my third Blu phone. I have finished setting up this phone and am really impressed! I was a little concerned after reading some reviews that said there was no quick access menu. This was false. I'm guessing that Blu fixed an issue that was in the test phones. Anyway, this device is fast, has lots of storage, a good amount of RAM, and a price that can't be beat.\", \"I just got this phone today as an upgrade from my LG Stylo 2 Plus. I am totally satisfied with all the features it offers and have yet to find anything major that I dislike about it so far. I am giving the battery a full charge and taking it out tomorrow to play music at work so I can update this post about how good the battery life is but with 4100 mAh I'm not expecting any issues.I am using an already activated Net 10 sim in this and it instantly worked after popping it in. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are working great and with the MaxxAudio my bluetooth headphones are even louder than before. The earbuds this phone comes with aren't that bad either honestly (for a free pair) and I'll probably find a time to use those as well.My favorite part about this phone so far has got to be how responsive the fingerprint sensor is, I mean it is lightning fast and reads my finger every time. My older LG had trouble with that and would take over 1 second to unlock even when the fingerprint was accurately read.As you can see in some reviews, this does indeed come with a free screen protector pre-installed + and extra one, as well as an acrylic or silocone type case with the box design on it. I know some people have complained about the settings being different but after just a few hours of playing with this thing I'm totally fine with swiping up from the bottom to access that quick drawer.I will have to play around with the camera settings more but the real-time bokeh and depth of field effects sem to be working great. My selfies look great now and I can't wait to take a ton of pictures to put a dent into that 64GB of storage + 256GB SD I added.1 Drawback I have noticed is that when trying to charge the phone on anything other than the included brick + cable seems to be quite slow and doesn't get anywhere near that full charge in 2.5h mark. It is odd because what I was using is an Anker portable power unit with a 3A output (which drops to whatever the hardware plugged in can handle) and the Vivo X was actually losing battery% while showing a charging symbol and having no apps open. When using the included brick and charging cable it seems to be charging at a good speed now though so I will see if anything changes tomorrow once I play with some settings more.My one other concern is that it is running Android 7.0 but hopefully this will be the model that BLU begins throwing out more updates for. I did feel a little hopeful about that when right after powering it on it told me I had a system SW update. So we will see what the future holds. None of these issues are enough to make me want to give this any less than 5 stars in any case.Sorry for this being a bit long-winded but this is the kind of info I would look for in a review so I wanted to make it available to others out there. In conclusion, I haven't been paid anything by this company or seller and I am honestly recommending this phone to anyone looking for something with some amazing features at an even better value.\", \"Just received this phone 2 days ago and so far it's has impressed me very much. I have owned several blu phones and this one it's so fat the best I ever had.  It's fast, snappy,  great screen, amazing battery life and awesome camera front and back. I can't belive it lol I know it's a ported phone but I'm glad they did this one cause it works.  I git it for $199 but even if I had paid $299 it's still worth it. I'll update more later on as use it more.\", 'So 2 months ago I got excited about the Honor 7x. It let me down in a big way. During my search for a replacement, I found this phone. I had purchased a cheaper blu phone for my father and it performed well but was a very budget phone at $99. This Vivo x destroyed the performance of the Honor 7x and most of the features on the Honor were locked out. The Vivo x is probably the best phone Ive ever had. It is better than my Iphone 7 was as I despised it,  better then every Android phone I have ever used. The phone even has dual band wifi and 4 cameras. There are a few things I wish were improved, but on the whole it is amazing.The things I wish it had added:USB-C would be niceWireless chargingNFCAndroid 8+These 4 Things would make the phone the best thing ever. We might still get Android 8 however. I can also live without NFC as I feel camera and scanning codes are much more universal. I have no devices with USB-C but understand it is similar to the Lightning cable from Iphone, so that would have been cool.', 'This is my first Blu phone to date and I\\'m very impressed both by price (I was able to purchase at the $199 promo) and build quality.The four camera setup is outstanding. The included 64gb of storage is more than most phones come with by default. The 4gb of ram make the phone incredibly snappy and responsive.My biggest complaint is with the somewhat skinned Android 7... I found installing Nova Launcher made all the difference in the world for customization. I\\'m still unhappy I don\\'t have a pull down drawer from the top of the phone to quickly and easily change settings, but that\\'s again something an app can easily solve.My previous smartphone background is mostly of the bigger/biggest models available: the Nexus 6 (6\" screen), the Samsung Galaxy Mega 2 (6\" screen) and the Lenovo Phab 2 (6.44\" screen). With this phone the real estate seems stretched (because of the aspect ration being 18:9 on the Vivo X vs. 16:9 on the others) but perhaps that\\'s just something to get used to as time goes along.I\\'m very happy with this phone and the value included in the purchase price that I paid (I was in the market for a new phone, but probably would have balked or waited longer if I had to pay more than $199). My original choice was the Honor 7x, but with Amazon not reliably stocking it for more than two weeks and my desperation for something new, I jumped on this phone and haven\\'t regretted it yet.', 'Good phone. Nice, big 6\" curved screen. Minimal bezel. Fast. Easy to handle and operate. Loud notifications, ring and alarm. Fast fingerprint sensor. Charges fast, very good battery life. I can easily go an entire day with heavy usage and still have some battery life left. Simple UI, which I personally prefer. Minimal pre-installed apps. I would prefer a choice of colors, but the included case is nice. In fact it has a slight texture and isn\\'t slippery or too smooth. It also comes with earphones and of course a charger. Not a large amount of customization options, but again great price.For settings and options, swipe up from the bottom of the screen instead of down from the top. Not hard to get used to. Earphone jack is on the bottom, not my preference but not a deal breaker. I used the nano SIM from my previous phone, it fits only into the SIM 2 tray. SIM 1 tray requires micro SIM card or SD.The dual cameras are VERY good. This feature is just about the most important for me. Very impressed with this quad camera setup. That alone makes this phone worth a try. I posted examples.Overall, I definitely recommend this Blu Vivo X. I did quite a bit of comparisons, and in this price range you really can\\'t go wrong.']\n",

      "[\"I was very excited when I saw that BLU announced this phone. I am a bit disappointed that it has a low resolution screen and no USB-C. However, after receiving it and spending the past few hours getting it setup, it is still an awesome phone. I'll be testing out the cameras this weekend. I am also glad that it uses two SIMs. For those curious, it does force you to choose between using the secondary SIM or an SD card. Luckily, it comes with a 64GB ROM. That is plenty for me. The included case is really slick. I hope some hard shell options become available.\", \"Very happy with this phone. I upgraded and wanted to make sure I got the most phone for my money so when this went on sale for $199 I knew it was the right one. Easy setup and just dropped my sim card in and ran perfectly without any issue. The phone feels premium and solid in your hand and doesn't feel cheap. I haven't tested the cameras yet but will update once I do. I even dropped the phone face down on tile today and there wasn't any damage. Overall this is a great option for someone who wants all of the features for 1/3 the price.\", \"Let me preface this by saying for the last 4 years I've only had HTC phones. My most recent one being a HTC One M9. This phone is such a breath of fresh air coming from that one. For one the Blu Vivo X phone has a bigger screen, the camera quality is superb and the games I play run extremely smooth. So far I haven't had any real problems with this phone. A few personal preferences, but no real issues. Most of the problems being setting issues, as well as lack of phone cases so far. But the phone is extremely new so I understand that. I've also never owned a Blu phone so I had no idea what I was coming into, but I did research on multiple phones before buying this one and honestly nothing stacked up to this phone. For the price, it's extremely worth it. Would 100% recommend.\", 'This was BLU\\'s last chance with me, and I must say they have hit it out of the park. What you have to remember is that you didn\\'t pay $1,000 for this phone, you paid ~$200 for it.It is fast and solid  phone. Works with MintSIM, the other two I had, I couldn\\'t get sms to work at all. An unlocked phone that won\\'t work with a carrier? My Moto G5S plus works right out of the box.I will be running 2 sims soon and although I\\'m not crazy about the either or of the SIM or SD card arrangement, it does have 64gig of internal storage which is plenty for me.I love the cameras ,and there are 4 of them, and the card scan feature. It scans a card and fills in the information for you. And it works!!!If you are planning on an update to oreo? DON\\'T!!! BLU is NOT known for updating their phones, IF you are planning on immediate updates to the newest software, you are looking at the wrong company!!!! Look at their website, they have like 4 phones that are available to update to marshmallow!!! Oreo? Really?... IF you want all the stuff that goes with a flagship, spend $1,000 and buy a flagship. If you budget won\\'t allow that kind of spending and you are ok with \"out-dated\" software, then go for it!', \"Wow, what deal!This phone has a beautiful display, outstanding battery life, dual SIM cards, microSD expandable, fingerprint reader, and an 8-core processor.  The phone gets much better wifi and LTE signal strength than my previous Android phones and after all day with wifi, LTE, bluetooth the battery is still at 79%.Although the display resolution (1440x720) is lower than higher priced phones, the display quality doesn't at all suffer and there is no apparent pixelation of fonts.  The display clarity is excellent and the lower resolution helps on battery life.The Android is a relatively stock Android Nougat distribution without much bloat.  My only complaint is BLU's distribution downloads some adware and games at startup but these are easily removed.I'd recommend this phone 100%!\", 'My previous phone was a ZTE Axon 7, but I wasn\\'t happy with the camera. I was initially planning to purchase the Honor 7x, but then I heard about the Vivo X and was intrigued by the cameras. I\\'ve had the Vivo X for a few days now, and here have been my experiences so far:- Micro SIM: I did not realize that this phone can ONLY take a micro SIM. I was using a nano SIM with my ZTE Axon 7, so right away I had a problem. I decided to purchase a new Straight Talk SIM so I could port my Google Voice number/gain a local number in the process. The port went fine as far as calls were concerned, but text messages weren\\'t working. I spent quite a long time on the phone with Straight Talk customer service, and they were going to transfer me to AT&T because they said things were fine on their end. Turns out my texts weren\\'t working because of a strange feature on the Vivo X (see next paragraph).- White List (of doom): The Vivo X has this thing when you switch between apps where it shows you how much RAM you have available, which is nice because it can help you optimize your phone. If you long press this, it will take you to this thing called White List, and you also have the option there to automatically clean up memory after the phone\\'s screen is turned off. I had enabled this feature thinking it would help with my battery performance. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. With White List, you need to manually add the apps you want to be protected from cleaning. Because I hadn\\'t added my messaging app, my texts weren\\'t going through, and I couldn\\'t receive them either. Ultimately I think White List could be useful but was poorly executed, and I hope this might save someone else from going through the same trouble.- Cameras and photo quality: I\\'m really happy so far! The Vivo X\\'s photos are waaay better than the Axon 7\\'s. I\\'ve included a few examples. Phone seems to struggle a bit in low/more yellow light, but I\\'m happy with the built-in gallery editor. I choose that over Pixlr or the Photos app on this phone.- Very customizable: This is definitely stock Android, which has taken some getting used to, but you can actually tweak a lot in settings, even though it might take some digging. (ie, the Vivo X defaults to vibrating on touch, and it took me forever to find the setting to adjust that. It\\'s under \"other sounds\" in \"sound and vibration.\")- Display and screen quality: The Vivo X comes pre-installed with a screen protector, which is a nice touch. It also includes an extra screen protector in the box. I know a lot of people are concerned about the 720p display, but I honestly don\\'t think it\\'s too noticeable. Would be nice if the screen got a bit brighter, though.So far I\\'m really happy I made the switch, especially for the price.', \"Wow this phone is the build quality of a Pixel XLAndroid 7, but slightly different os menu pulls up from bottom and is adjustable in settings, very fast, bloatwear from Blu is able to be disabled, and all notifications can be adjusted, very clean look, the only thing I don't like is the black and white pattern plastic coverit came with lol. However the quality white head phones that it comes with make up for the hideous case..... Hold a charge for the entire day, fast charges well, however I pared this with the ANKER 39w car charger and ANKER heavy duty charging cable made of Kevlar and thicker wiring, this improved charging time. Camera has a gazillion features and the touch sensor on back also works well.\", \"I had the Blu Life one X2 so I wasn't going to change phones very easily. I was still very happy and pleased with my Life One x2 after two years of having it and was waiting for a new phone that I thought would be on the same level as the Life One X2 but around the same price range. I decided to give the Blu Vivo X a chance.... so far I'm loving it!It's fast, reliable and looks great! The only thing that annoys me is that some apps do not fill the entire screen, but that's not the phones fault.-It was a bit tricky trying to work out how to do high quality screen captures.-Also I thought it was like the Life One X2 as in I could insert two sim cards/chips and a mini SD memory card at the same time, this is not the case, you can only insert two sim cards/chips or one sim card/chip and one Mini SD memory card at a time. While you can setup two separate Whatsapps... you can only receive phone calls for the sim card/chip that you have inserted...\", 'This is everything that I have ever wanted from a phone. I have never owned a Blu phone before and this is my first. I have to say that this is just a common sense phone. Even if you pay $200 or $250, I think the value here is phenomenal.I don\\'t believe that the gimmicks of higher end smartphones or even the compromises of other low end smartphones can complete with what this phone has to offer. For example what good are gimmicks if your phone doesn\\'t last? While I was between moving I purchased this phone. While I didn\\'t have WiFi and it was constantly looking for a signal. I got well over 37 hours and over 6 of those being screen on time. The next time I went to charge it? This time I had WiFi and alot of heavy use. 28 hours total, over 10.5 of those hours with screen on time. You can easily make it through 3+ days with light/moderate use before charging. It\\'ll get through 2 days with heavy use before needing to be charged... That\\'s awesome!It\\'s close to stock Android. So 4GB of RAM, a 2.6 Ghz processor... Is going to manhandle in tasks that you do on this phone. I couldn\\'t get it to lag while downloading and installing apps while using maps..So my last phone had a 1080p display, a phone I had before that had a quad HD display... Even though on paper this is only a little better than 720p... I honestly have to say they worked some magic because it genuinely looks better than the last 1080p phone I had. If you\\'re worried about things being blurry or small text not being legible.. that\\'s not the case here.  The 6\" display is beautiful to look at.The camera is good from the few pictures that I\\'ve taken. I haven\\'t tested it too extensively but this seems to be pretty far beyond passable.All in all I highly recommend this phone. It even cones with a screen protector already on. It comes with another screen protector, and a case. I wasn\\'t taxed for this purchase either. So if I bought a $200 phone and all of those things with tax it would have been more than what I paid anyway. If you need a new phone this is the one.', \"The Vivo X, reminds me of the Pixel XL or Samsung Galaxy S8+. It's a quality device on a budget. There’s a nice curved edge to it just about everywhere you look; the front screen has a curved display and the back has its own share of tapered edge. The camera on the phone is excellent in my opinion. It takes just as good of photos as the iphone X.I'm with Metro PCS and the phone works great with it. If you're looking for a budget phone with a flagship feel and specs, definitely get this phone.

      "[\"Upgrading from the Vivo 8 I bought last year there are a few peculiar spec changes (I'm assuming there's a bit of a trade-off in order to keep battery life as good as it is) The screen has lower resolution; (vivo 8: 1080:1920 vivo X: 720:1440), and the the one speaker isn't nearly as loud as the vivo 8 double speaker, but the much faster processor and dual front and back cameras are well worth the trade. I've been doing a lot more gaming on this phone and haven't had any trouble running any of the most demanding games.\", 'I think this phone is awesome. The only issue I have is the same issue I have with all BLU phones and that is the bluetooth issue. Where the phone has to be reset daily for the bluetooth to function when switching between my cars and headsets. Also every few weeks there is a problem with Google Play Services on my BLU phones and the apps wont update. I have to hard reset the phones to get it to work again. Other than that This phone rocks.', \"Love this phone. I worked for Big Red for almost a decade and have seen a ton of phones come and go.... I have to say this is one of the best one's that I've used in a long time. It's rather quick, split screen is wonderful and when I use my slingbox on it to watch tv, the picture is great. I've had great reception in area's where I didn't have as much luck with prior phones.  I do agree with others that the case is a bit ugly but it was free so I can't complain too much. Well worth 249.99 or even the 300 when it goes up in price.\", 'Very trustworthy seller, Fast Shipping with Prime.Blu phones are great! This Vivo X is very smooth operation and great features. Thank you Blu for another great phone.', \"I just received this phone today. So far so good. This phone is awesome! So far no complaints. I will update after a few weeks of use.***Update***After a little more than a week with the VIVO X i can honestly say that I am very impressed. I haven't experienced any oh the problems others have expressed. The cellular reception it noticeably the best I have had in a long time from other devices that I have used on AT&T. The battery life is great! I am getting 36-40 hours on moderate to heavy use. The screen is awesome. Cameras are really good. The phones performance is very fast. One thing that I didn't like initially was if you want to use a micro SD card you have to use the Micro Sim card tray, I have a Nano Sim and the tray where the SD card goes is also the tray that the Nano card fits. Then I realized that I could by an adapter for my Sim card., problem solved. I think its a good design using both the Nano and the Micro Sim card options. Although if you want to use duel Sim cards you are not able to use an SD card.But with 64GB built in memory you may not need an SD card if you are going to use two Sim cards.  That isn't a big deal for me because I only use one Sim card in my phone. Bottom line for $250 I believe that this phone is worth every penny. Although I was lucky enough to get in on the $199 introduction price!! This is my first Blu Products phone and it will certainly not be my last!  Great phone! No complaints!\", \"This phone is superb! This is the first time that I have purchased a Blu phone and I don't regret it. I wanted a budget phone could do most things that the latest brand phones can do, but also compatible with cricket mobile. These guys have awesome customer service also!\", \"Finally, BLU got it right!!! After buying and having to return two Vivo 8L and a Life One X3 because of multiple issues with the phones, I can finally say that I am happy with my purchase. Can't beat all the specs this phone has (better than most mid-rangers) and at a price of 199$. The phone works great, no issues whatsoever unlike past BLU phones. Love the UI and all the camera modes it has. Most people walkaway from this phone when they read that the screen resolution is 720p, but I got to say, the screen looks gorgeous, way better than what I expected. Battery life is amazing too, ranging from 1.5-2 days on a single charge, and it also charges up really fast. The only thing I wish was different is that the default phone app is google phone which I don't like. After testing out this phone and reading and watching a lot of online reviews I dare to say that this phones is better than the Honor 7X, the Asus Zenfone Max Plus M1, the old Nokia 6, the LG Q6, and the Motorolas. All in all great device for the price.\", \"I absolutely love this phone, I went from Blu Vivo 5 to Vivo 5R, to this. This great everything, Great Camera, great size, great display (looks better than full HD screen the Vivo 5R has), great performance due to it's specs, great sound and i got great price ($199).\", \"This is a very nice phone. Good looking, snappy performer. The screen is very nice, even if it isn't the highest resolution. Apps open quickly, and the phone is not preloaded with a lot of bloatware. Even though the phone uses the older micro USB port, fast charging is supported. The 4 cameras take decent pictures, and post processing is very quick. The camera app has many great features, and is easy to use. All of the GSM bands in the USA are supported, and I had no trouble at all getting LTE working. I am very pleased with my purchase. I would have no problem recommending this phone to others. Good job, Blu. Excellent phone for an excellent price, well worth the money.\", \"Great phone so farCan't get some app to view in full screen like FacebookSound will sometime go from high to lowIf you don't like the case that come with it . You can remove the black and white with nail polish remover.\"]\n",

Very good camera.There are several things that BLU will have to change in the near future: USB type C it's a must right now. Also, a resolution of 720p it's not enough. And the last thing, being release on Feb 2018, how is it possible it doesn't come with Android 8?Anyway, it's a cool phone, big display, very nice camera and very good and big battery (in terms of capacity).\", \"THIS PHONE IS AMAZING, A MUST BUY...IT HAS FOUR CAMERAS A SPEEDY PROCESSOR AND A LONG LASTING BATTERY....I'VE AVERAGED ONE IN A HALF DAYS WITH HEAVY USE WITH NO PROBLEMS. THE 6 INCH SCREEN, SLIM BEZELS AND 18:9 RATIO MAKES THE PHONE LOOK LIKE A  NEXT GEN PHONE. THE BELOW FIRING SPEAKER IS LOUDER THAN MY S8..THE ONLY THING HOLDING IT BACK FROM GETTING FIVE STARS IS NO USB-C AND THE 720P SCREEN WHICH IS NICE AND SHARP BUT IT DOES HAVE QUICK CHARGING.\", \"Having worked in Retail mobile shops I honestly don't understand how Blu can offer such amazing value, By far one of the best phones out there. You won't believe how fast and how responsive the Vivo X is. You won't believe the quality they offer at such a good price. If your looking for a phone that has a great camera, Loud Speakers, and outstanding battery life to which even Apple can't even compete offers 4010MAH were the latest Iphone is 2716 lol, it's clear which phone offers more value and better quality then most overpriced flagship devices, overall very solid phone THANKS BLU!\", \"This BLU VIVO X is a great phone. Big Screen, Long Battery Life. I have had no issues at all. I'm using Cricket Wireless and it works great. This is a good phone and it even comes with a case. Quick service and delivery. Very Satisfied.\", \"I will update after I contact the manufacturer. I recieved the phone with Android 7.0, not Android 7.0 nougat as advertised. There is a big difference as nougat allows more customization of the horribly large app icon sizes and many other features. I have checked for a system update to fix but have yet to receive one. Hopefully manufacturer will fix this issue, otherwise I'll be returning the phone for refund.\", \"I really like this phone the performance is good the cameras are good and the 6 inch screen is big enough and sharp enough. The only reason I don't give it 5 Stars just because I know yes there are some super high-end phones out there that cost 8 or $900 that have a sharper screen and even faster performance but this is more than adequate.\", \"I was lucky enough to get this phone during the $199 introductory period.  It was a cinch to setup with Cricket.  I just took the sim card out of my old iphone and it worked right away.  All of my apps installed easily too.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that my Fitbit Charge 2 was actually syncing with it and getting text & phone call notifications from my phone.  All in all it's a great phone and the price can't be beat.\", \"I LOVE this phone! It’s very different from my last phone, so it took some time to get used to, but with the help of my Carrier's (Consumer Cellular) customer service rep, set-up was accomplished and more. The audio on this phone is AMAZING - with or without the earbuds.  And speaking of the earbuds, they are way beyond what I expected. I have always hated earbuds because they would always fall out of my ears. The design on these are such that I have a snug and comfortable fit.  I love the metal casing of the phone over plastic. I love that it comes with 2 USB cables. One is the standard length cable that plugs into the charger. The other is a much shorter cable for direct connect to a laptop, netbook, etc.  Very convenient. Although I don’t need it, the phone has 2 SIM card capability, which is a fantastic idea. My micro SD card fits perfectly in the second SIM slot, so I have the additional storage I like. The only disappointment I have is use time on the battery. It wears down a lot faster than my previous phone, but this could be because I haven't yet given it the recommended 3 charges after the initial full charge. Also, I wish the key for the SIM card tray came with some sort of storage case.  It is easy to drop, lose, or lose sight of. All in all, though, I am VERY glad I bought this phone. In fact, I bought one (a similar model) for my sister for her birthday.\"]\n",

      "[\"Phone is quick and responsive. I haven't noticed any lag. No NFC but not a deal breaker for me. Came with a few anoying BLU bloatapps that i was able to disable. Good screen size and the phone doesn't feel big not heavy. At a moderate use the battery lasts me 2 days\", 'Just got my phone today. So far so good! It is as described by the seller, Open group wireless. The seller sent a business/support card in case of any problems, which I appreciate.', 'Good phone. Good specs. I switched it out for the vivo 8 because of better resolution and processor', \"I needed a new phone and I was searching for a new phone. I was thinking of getting the Vivo 8 but I saw that this phone was coming out soon so I decided that I would get this phone. I was fully ready to pay $300 for it, but the launch price was $200. I ordered it and it arrived 2 days later. I gave myself a week to try out the phone before I wrote the review. In the box is the phone, a quick charge cable and power brick, headphones which are actually quite good, a case which looks neat but won't really protect the phone except from scratches, a screen protector on the phone and an extra one, a reverse charge cable, a sim tool, and all the booklets you could need. I love the design of the phone. It looks really nice and feels really nice in my hand. The phone feels sturdy and doesn't feel cheap in any way. Using the fingerprint sensor is very quick and really useful. It also has face unlock and voice recognition but I haven't tried those yet. The screen looks great and the fact that it's 6 inches and an 18:9 HD display is really good. The phone is very quick with 4 GB of RAM and it's responsive and has plenty of storage space whether you want every app in the world, take a million photos, or play games. It runs games really well and can be used for mobile gaming. It has a monster battery, 4,010 mAh which is enough to last at least a full day of heavy usage. It also has a quick charger which charges the phone very quickly. The four cameras are something I never expected to see in a phone at $200 and they are really good. The camera has a lot of cool features and is very fun to use. All in all, a very awesome phone for $200. I would pay $500 for a phone this good. It is weird having the settings as a swipe up from the bottom, but I actually like it. It separates the quick settings from the notifications so neither is cluttered together. All in all, it's an amazing phone and for the price, it's unbeatable.\", \"I've had several BLU phones over the years and all have performed better than expected. The VivoX is no exception. This phone has real flagship performance & features at budget pricing. The battery life is amazing. I bought this on sale for $199 and couldn't be more satisfied.

I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new phone.', 'FINAL UPDATE: Officially going to have to retire the phone.  The screen is shattered.  I was kneeling and reached out to put my hand on the ground, which resulted in the phone slipping out of my hoodie pocket.  That was about a maybe two-foot drop, if that?  Obviously this was my fault, but a drop from that height shouldn\\'t have resulted in any damage.  :( I can\\'t imagine the damage from a standing drop.UPDATE:  It\\'s the third day, and my phone is internally destroying itself.  The battery won\\'t tick down now, I can\\'t scroll anymore, the auto brightness isn\\'t updating, my calendar is erasing my data, and texts aren\\'t going through.  I must say that I am VERY disappointed in this phone.  For $250 (what I paid, originally $300 without sale), there shouldn\\'t be this many problems.  I\\'m debating if I should skip the exchange, and just go straight for the return.----------I\\'m pretty conflicted with this phone.  I want to adore it, however there are some pretty major setbacks that I\\'m not sure if I can look past.  With that being said, I\\'d still recommend this for the price.----------Pros:- The screen is big but you don\\'t get a big phone.  I\\'ve strayed away from 6\" because I\\'m a little person, but I quite like holding this because it\\'s skinny enough that small hands can hold it and also enjoy a \"big boy\" screen.- It\\'s smooth.  It\\'s definitely faster and more smooth than my last phone (HTC Desire Eye).  Installing apps is lightning fast, scrolling through google is a breeze, and having multiple apps in the background doesn\\'t slow it down.- Sound quality is quite good.  It\\'s bass-y, which I like.  It picks up the slightest noise though, which could be great or bad depending on the situation I guess.  It goes quite loud as well.- Plenty of storage.  You\\'ll be able to fit thousands of photos, songs, and quite a lot of apps onto this phone.- Fingerprint scanner is awesome.  I\\'ve never had a phone that did this, so it\\'s kind of fun. :)- Messaging notification drop-down is AMAZING.  I LOVE this feature.  I was pleasantly surprised when someone texted me and I was able to read/reply from the drop-down, all while staying on whatever page.- You can do split-screen.  I think it depends on the app though.  In theory, it\\'s great that you can have two pages up at a time.- Android nougat is so nice.  I had Android 5.0 with my last phone.  Upgrading to 7 is definitely what I needed, and hoping for an update to Android 8 in the next year, maybe?- The actual feel of the phone is high-end.  It feels like a top-rated phone, but without the pricetag.- All of Google\\'s apps come already installed.  I personally don\\'t use many of Google\\'s features, so luckily it\\'s easy to remove them and add some extra storage to the phone.- It came with a screen protector already on, an extra screen protector in the box, and a case as well!  It also came with the standard charging accessories and some earbuds.- Fast startup/reboot.  The initial startup is a bit slow and worrisome, but it\\'s just the one time as it gets itself ready for you!  After that, turning it on is quick.Cons:- The camera.  So many problems with it.  I\\'ll go into detail at the end of this post.  This is the biggest obstacle holding me back from possibly sticking with this.  My last phone had a superb camera that was clear, could focus on micro surroundings, adjusted perfectly to light...  And this camera fails in all those areas.- The resolution IS as advertised.  No you won\\'t be getting the clearest of words on your screen, but it\\'s passable.  It\\'s noticeable if you switch from a better resolution phone like I did though.- The lack of cases is strange, I must admit.  Hopefully some more come out soon.- No theme, at least not that I could tell.  I think all of my past Androids of recent years have had an option for different interface themes.  This doesn\\'t seem to have this feature.- I couldn\\'t access ANY ringtones/notification alerts.  I had to download a ringtone app.- 14GB of my 64GB was already taken up.  I can\\'t figure out what\\'s taking up so much space.  I\\'ve gotten rid of any bloatware (luckily wasn\\'t a lot, so great job, BLU), but 14 is still a lot.----------I\\'d love to give it 5 stars, but there\\'s just one thing that\\'s so jarring to me, and I don\\'t understand it at all...  When you use your camera (back and front), the window on your screen is crisp and beautiful (back is, front is lackluster).  But when you go to look at the image, it\\'s blurry.  It\\'s like it goes from the supposed 13MP+, down to maybe an 8MP (at best) once the picture is actually taken.  I\\'m pretty miffed at this.  I mean, really, the camera specs are a lie.To go along with the camera, it also has a hard time focusing on things close to it.  For example, selfies are a joke.  You get that perma-airbrushed look even without the beauty filter on.  I have freckles, but you can\\'t see them in the photos.  Some different camera apps make the clarity and focusing a bit better, but you\\'d more than likely have to deal with obnoxious ads unless you want to pay for a different camera app.----------Overall, I\\'m not exactly happy with it, but I\\'m not mad either.  I  really wish the camera was better.  I switched from a 2014 phone which excelled in that area, so it\\'s sort of hard to downgrade after spending a couple hundred bucks.  I did upgrade in many areas which is nice though.  I sort of want to return the item, but I might keep it.  Luckily I\\'m not a huge selfie taker, so I may not care too much about the problem a week from now.']\n",

The phone is long and sticks out of my pack pocket.  Wished Blu just stuck to pure android- skin a bit annoying.  Not water resistant.  Micro-usb is dated.  Doesn't charge as fast as quick charge.
