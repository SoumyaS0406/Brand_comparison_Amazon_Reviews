Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 6, 2016",1.0,Manufacturer Defect,"The Galaxy S7 was wonderful while it worked. Great screen, great battery life, decent software, amazing camera, MicroSD slot. Everything you'd want in a phone. The waterproof claim is also impressive, although I was never bold enough to test it. I put the phone in a rugged UAG case and babied it, hoping to get a few years out of it.However, six months after purchasing, the screen suddenly began to die. Half the screen is now dead despite there being no physical damage or trauma to the phone. I babied this thing, seriously. No drops, no scratches, no cracks, nothing. I suspect a manufacture defect with the screen's connector or something. First, I called Samsung. They refuse to repair international versions of the Galaxy S7, even if you offer to pay for the repair. Then, I called the seller about getting this repaired or RMA'd. They didn't respond. I contacted Amazon and they also contacted the seller. No response. I called the seller, no one picked up the phone and the voice mail box was full. Spend the extra cash and get this from a different seller. I'm out a lot of money for a faulty phone.For more information about this defect google ""vertical lines in screen,"" - it seems fairly common and most people have a similar story."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 27, 2016",1.0,False advertising,The description on this phone said Dual Sim and it wasn't.  I tried putting in a second SIM after buying one and was told the phone was for a single SIM.  That is false marketing.  I want myou money back or a DUAL Sim phone
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"November 10, 2016",5.0,overall I'm pretty satisfied. I was afraid I would get a ...,"I bought this on June 29, 2016. So far this phone has given me no problems. It doesn't overheat, there are no problems with the software, it hasn't  turned off unexpectantly, overall I'm pretty satisfied. I was afraid I would get a bad one but I didn't. The camara quality is amazing! I'm completely satisfied."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 8, 2017",1.0,Was a fake phone!,"If there was a 0 star of rate that. Recueved the phone in a s7 box. Came completely dead. Charged, took 10 hours to fully charge. Started going through it and it didn't have most of the features a s7 has. Took it to a phone place only to be told it was a fake. The serial number was fake everything was fake. Had it confirmed by another it was indeed a fake s7. Returned same day then they wanted me to pay return postage on a free shipping item. Nope. Then didn't refund the entire amount I paid. Then tried to return the money on an Amazon gift card! Nope! 2 weeks later and countless calls finally have returned complete. 100% fake phone! Pls do your research on what an actual s7 can do and then compare to this. Its missing ALOT!"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 9, 2017",1.0,So it turned into a waste of time and a huge,Would rate 0 stars if i could doesn't work with any carrier still had someone else's info signed in. So it turned into a waste of time and a huge headache
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 17, 2017",1.0,"Nice at first, then problems, now dead at 10 months","I bought this from seller ""The Wireless Circle"". I am a US AT&T customer in a 4G LTE market.First off, the phone came with the UK electrical outlet Fast Charger with an outlet adapter to US. This wasn't a problem to me other than bulkiness just not what I expected.Another thing, in the central midwest, I had a hard time being anywhere where I received good signal strength 4G LTE. I even called AT&T about it and attempted a new SIM card (thinking that possibly the card unlocked certain frequency bands). I ordinarily wouldn't care about this, except the battery statistics constantly say that the cell standby was using most of the battery.This weekend is when the real problem started. I was using the phone and when I looked back after a few seconds, the screen was frozen. I tried to end software but everything was unresponsive--the touch screen and the buttons. I tried restarting the phone: the power button produced no response. With older models, I would remove the battery at this point in time. In the last 2 days, I have tried charging, performing various button press combinations, and even taking the device to an AT&T authorized retailer. This phone is dead. 10 months at about $550.I would not recommend buying this phone unless you have a solid plan for returns/repairs/warranties."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 17, 2017",1.0,The phone stopped working after a few months and we ...,The phone stopped working after a few months and we can't refer to the manufacturers warranty in Vietnam! They have no english support and we were given very little help from Breed or Amazon.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 11, 2018",3.0,it is a very cool phone! it is sturdy,I am more of a Nexus / PIxel User! I bought this phone for my mother! And to be honest! I could have bought a Pixel for the same price! And i would be having less issues! (with issues i mean my mother asking me stuff about samsung apps that don't do anything helpfull) Everything in this phone OS has been modified by Samsung! if you ask me the Samsung layer is completely over rated! Everything is trying to go over the basic android functions but with a Samsung App! That means you have a ton of apps that you can't remove because they are part of the Samsung layer! And you could do exactly the same with the Native andoid tools/apps using less memory!But don't take my word for it! it is a very cool phone! it is sturdy! well made! but again! i bought this one for my Mother! i would never bought this phone for me! i am planing to change my actual NExus 6 phone for a Pixel 2!
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 21, 2017",3.0,IT'S A GREAT PHONE OUTSIDE OF THE PURPLE LINE,I WOULD ASSUME BECAUSE THIS PHONE MAY HAVE BEEN REFURBISHED. HOURS AFTER UNBOXING I HAD A PERMANENT PURPLE LINE THAT IS DUE TO A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. THE COMPANY I CAN SAY IS RELUCTANT TO SEND REPLACEMENTS SO I STILL HAVE MY ORIGINAL PURCHASED PHONE. IT'S A GREAT PHONE OUTSIDE OF THE PURPLE LINE. WORD TO THE WISE THE PHONE SERIES HAVE A SCREEN DEFECT DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH IT. THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS THAT S7 SERIES HOLDS
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"November 22, 2016",4.0,I purchase this phone from the merchant Mobiles International LLC ...,"I purchase this phone from the merchant Mobiles International LLC and was shipped by amazon, the phone was unlock brand new and came in a seal box. I live in Trinidad and it was fully unlock."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 16, 2018",4.0,So far so good. I have choosen Exynos version of processor from ...,"So far so good. I have choosen Exynos version of processor from international stock. Phone is unlocked, looks new. No broken box etc. Contact with seller was good, and they answered all questions. The only problem with s7 is that the front screen and gold edges get dirty really fast. Finger prints all over the place. Phone after initial set up got the newest available system update to Nougat. Works fast. Hope it will keep working like that."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 25, 2017",5.0,Very satisfied with this phone,"I love this phone, a big upgrade from my samsung s5, fast, perfect size, elegant look, very easy to use. Most important, it was in original seal."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 17, 2018",1.0,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM WIRELESS EVERYTHING/WIRELESS PLACE,My phone froze for about 3 seconds then stopped working. Will not turn on or charge. I googled every way to fix it. No safe mode or recovery mode. No way to fix it. On my invoice it says seller was Wireless Everything. After clicking on it it says seller Wireless Place. They had a number that I tried calling only leading to voicemail. I tried contacting them and nothing. Save yourself from a future problem. I purchased twice from them. Lost my first phone.My second just stopped working after year. Never been dropped or wet. Had it in a folding case. Purchase from another seller.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 29, 2017",5.0,Samsung galaxy done right,Absolutely in love with my Samsung galaxy s7. The phone lasts for a long time compared to most phones and it fits comfortably on one hand. This is similar to the iphones such as the fingerprint unlocking is pressed down like the iphones. Also to get the sim card and the SD card out you need a pin just like the iphones. The SD card allows the phone to hold more space than the 32GB that is included in the phone. Also this phone is pretty slim unlike my former Samsung Note 4.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 5, 2018",5.0,Still a great phone!,"An awesome phone and considering the age and the price it definitely holds up to any modern smartphone, not surprising because it's only two and a half years old. But it's upgradeable to the current Android software and comes with all the features you would expect. Love the water resistance especially coming from a phone that had no water resistance. My only complaint is sometimes switching to Bluetooth to phone and headphones causes a glitch where the sound well only come out of the phone speaker and not the main speaker, however this only happens rarely and usually a restart will fix it. Overall I love this phone probably be best phone I've ever had, would definitely recommend if you need a good smartphone and want to have a little cheaper price:)"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 4, 2017",5.0,Great phone,"Loved every minute of this phone. Going on 6 months now.Has only frozen on me one time, not sure why.Only complaint is the lack of a removable battery."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 13, 2016",4.0,Good Hardware Design with Bloatware.,"The hardware of this phone is reaaaaaaally decent but the software is not, I really dislike the bloatware Samsung put into the phone. My previous phone is Nexus 5, I pretty like the Google apps. There is something called Package disabler on Google Play store, non-free but only $0.99. I spent an afternoon disable the pre-installed applications and installed Google apps. It turns out very good.I don't like the screen color BTW, seems too saturated to me.I ordered a black color, but it came with Champagne color, seems good to me, and I'll keep it."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 12, 2017",1.0,I do not trust this seller.,"This phone has given me nothing but problems over the last year. I was hesitant to make a review but the motherboard crashed now, and cannot afford to fix it. There was no way this was a new S7 with all the problems I have been having, and it really sucks to be in this situation after spending so much money."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 12, 2016",4.0,A very delicate beast of a phone,"This phone is a beast! It performs perfectly.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 23, 2016",5.0,This is hands down the best mobile I have ever had to date,This is hands down the best mobile I have ever had to date.  As a flagship device I am not sure there is anything I would rather have.  The camera has to be the best upgraded feature as it's stunning how it blows away my previous iPhone shots.  The waterproof shell is outstanding and I couldn't ask for a better device.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 27, 2016",4.0,No charger BUT otherwise great!,"This phone is GREAT, it's all I hoped it would be. I would have given it 5 stars BUT I did not get a charging port that is compatible with the regular wall socket 😒, instead I got this adapter which has no ends for a wall socket & that was it so I was upset but i just used my old Samsung  charger since this was an upgrade. Apart from THAT problem everything was GREAT"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 14, 2016",5.0,Deal!,"Came ready to use out of the box! I didn't have to use a Euro sim first or request an unlock code from Samsung. Just as good as an American S7, some say better because of the Exynos 8890 processor. Great deal!"

I paid 540$ for a brand new phone and it comes with the seal broken and also the F***** box damaged. Who the hell is in charge of this, did a terrible job. You should not be selling things on Amazon. I don't even know what the hell is happening with my phone now, if they took the liberty to open it before hand."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 5, 2016",5.0,excelent but...,"Great device, really solid construction, perfect performing even with touchwiz. The redudant apps are annoying, why would you ever need two music players, two mail ecosystem, two foto galleries, Samsung should learn from other manufacturers about that, let the user decide...Lack of removable battery is an issue, I'll like to see if I ever need to change my battery how difficult is it with the IP protection,so sealed package must be difficult to open...The return of the micro sd slot is a great goal and the camera is exclent and really quick,I mean REALLY."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 3, 2017",1.0,Worst Experience,"If you ever have a issue with this phone and contact support, they cant help you cause its a international phone.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 29, 2018",5.0,Works in the US on  AT &T.,I bought the galaxy s7 international version.  I wanted a gsm phone that was both carrier and region unlocked.  That is exactly what I received.  I was a little hesitant upon seeing the phone was from Saudi Arabia.  I used the phone for a month as a trial run to verify that the phone was truly unlocked.

No problems at all registering with AT&T and their nano SIM works without problems. Highly recommended rather than buying fixed-carrier version.Slight issue with power button, seems to sit at a downward angle but can push to rotate it back to straight up-and-down - not sure if that's the design or a wobbly connection on my phone. Bought a case at the same time which covers the button anyway, so doesn't actually matter in practice."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"November 21, 2016",1.0,RESTARTS ON ITS OWN...CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL THE BATTERY DIES.,"After six months of careful usage and no drops or scratches on this phone, I agreed to a Security Update in October of this year. BAD IDEA. As soon as this happened, my phone began to restart. CONTINUOUSLY. OVER NIGHT. I went online to research and most users of the S7 suggest to do a factory reset. I emailed amazon.com and they directed me to a Samsung Customer Service website. I inquired about the damage and they gave me a step by step run through a factory reset. I made sure the battery was full. It was restarting so often that I could not even back up any of my data. I LOST EVERYTHING. I did the reset and it was okay for a few minutes. Just enough time to let me sign into my google account and proceed. It kept restarting. Overnight. I decided to do it one last time so I charged it. Glad I checked back on it after an hour because the device was HOT. I could not even hold it long enough to unplug the charger from the wall. I am just out of luck with this phone. I don't even know what to do or how to get it replaced. I understand the no warranty but what happens to customers like me who took damn good care of their expensive phone and only after a security patch update that the phone started to act up and never returning?!Has anyone had this issue? How was it resolved?"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 5, 2016",5.0,Great purchase! I originally had a U,"Great purchase! I originally had a U.S. Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930AZDAATT) on the AT&T network and when I got it wet, my cell phone insurance plan directed me to go ahead and buy a new phone.  Since the retail versions sold at AT&T stores would have run me $695 + tax, I decided to look at the international versions because they typically are a bit cheaper than the full retail versions in the states. Glad I went with this one.  After doing some research (which can be a pain to do) I found out that this SM-G930F cover almost all the same bands/radio frequencies that the U.S. AT&T uses.  I get great coverage for data, and about the same or slightly worse coverage for voice, but since I rely on data mostly, I am not complaining.  The phone actually seems to be a bit faster than my original S7 from AT&T, because it does not come loaded with as much bloatware (theres still some from Samsung, but not nearly as much as the U.S. carrier versions of the phone).  Also, the setup and activation was very easy.  It comes with the same nano-Sim card and micro-SD card tray (both fit on the tray and it slides into a port on the top of the phone) and after you pop in your carrier's nano-Sim card, it recognizes the nano-Sim and automatically connects.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase.  If I run into hardware or connectivity issues, I will post back here with an update. If there are no updates from me within the next month, then assume everything works well on the U.S. AT&T network (metro ATL location) using this international Galaxy S7."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 20, 2016",5.0,Why would you ever lease a phone??,"So, I am going to skip the review of the actual phone because that's been done and the previous reviews are good enough.Seller: From this seller on Amazon, mine came as the UK version with a UK plug. You'll have to go in and change some settings if you don't want your currency in GB Pounds and Google Maps in a British Accent. Well, I kept it because it's a good conversation starter.  These guys even went the extra mile and sent me an adaptor for the fast charger. Lukly, I had a U.S Fast Charger but, again, a good conversation starter.Network: I'm living in the US and on the AT&T (GSM) network, and it works perfect.Comments: My only concern moving on is if the S7's battery does get recalled, how is that going to work in the US with a UK warranty and Serial Number. Other than that, I wouldn't worry about anything from this seller. I would 10/10 buy again from these guys.Overall: Beats LEASING a phone from AT&T for $200 more than the international list price. I don't understand why one wouldn't go this route."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 31, 2016",4.0,Great phone!,"I will be starting off with good points of the phone,-3000 mAh battery: This is great due to most phones nowadays not having such large batteries, this makes the phone last very long throughout the day even through some pretty heavy use. And with the addition of quick charging, makes it lightning fast to charge and get moving.-IP68: This means the phone is dust and water resistant, so if the phone drops in water, there are no worries and it should work perfect after (has always for me)-SD card slot: Bringing this back was a great idea, now you can extend the space by adding a mini-SD card again.-12 MP f/1.7 back camera: This is honestly the best camera I've used on a smartphone in a while, as well as having a great auto-focus feature makes it even betterOnto the downsides,-Bloatware: Comes with a lot of bloatware apps that come preinstalled, pretty annoying but not too big of a problem-Removal of IR Blaster: Not many people did use this, but it was a very nice feature to use for TV's and what not.-Glass back and front, with metal rounded sides: This makes the phone extremely slippery and can be dropped very easily (Best to get a case or skin to make it less slippery)Overall, it is a great phone with great specs. Fast in everything I've done from gaming to watching videos to recording. Have had no issues so far with it. Amazing phone, Samsung."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 16, 2017",5.0,I used a stock version rom and the battery and tweaks are great. If you can afford to buy outright,"This is the way to go for those that do not want bloat from carriers. Got this in two days, rooted, and put on a custom rom right away. This unlocked for carriers and the bootloader is not locked either. I used a stock version rom and the battery and tweaks are great. If you can afford to buy outright, not a payment plan, this is what you should do. The only issue I see is the lack of us warranty, but I am not worried. The phone itself is great. I had a s6  that was driving me crazy as it had lag and design features they took out when they went from the s5 to the s6. The S7 is definitely worth the upgrade as I did not feel the need to get the s8. With the ability to put newer software at my discretion, I will keep the phone for years to come. Mobile International is who I got the phone from and it arrived quickly.The phone has been very responsive, great on battery so far and easy to navigate through items with software updates. The camera works well and my wifi connections have been much better than with the S6 (another reason I switched). The additional memory slot is a welcome return and the camera recognizes when inserted to automatically save pictures there.  This is nice so that it leaves room on the internal memory.I have not tested its ability to resist water (and do not plan it), but overall worth the cost of the phone. I will revise if I have any issues in the future."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 17, 2016",5.0,A Step Up from Xperia,"Above and beyond expectations. I came from the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, which I loved until their version of Android took a Marshmallow-sized dump and massively glitched out, becoming unusable. Sony's ""XPERIA™ Support"" was of absolutely no help in this matter. Before Xperia, I owned the Sony Z3 Compact and the Samsung Galaxy S2. Definitely glad I switched back to Samsung! The grass is NOT greener on the other side, believe me!I'll take Samsung's 12MP over Sony's 23MP any day. Far superior in the areas of auto-focus, low-light, and manual parameters. The Sony Z5 Compact can record 4K video as well, but not without tons of initial lag and post lag (storage, encapsulation). The Samsung S7 is relatively quick with 4K on the initial and reasonable with the post (when you finish recording).And the phone volume is LOUD. Usable, in fact. Sony's Z5 Compact was disappointingly quiet.Great phone."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 14, 2016",5.0,Five Stars,Very good product!
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 28, 2016",5.0,took like 3 minutes,"My mom and I both bought one. Came right on time, and was no trouble at all getting it activated by our company (MetroPCS). Don't listen to all those people saying it doesn't work with MetroPCS, it does! Just call them up and they'll be able to transfer your account to the new phone, took like 3 minutes.The phone itself is great. A bit slippery but nothing a good case can't fix. It does smudge if you touch it too much but just use a screen protector and a case and it'll be fine. All in all, great phone."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 29, 2016",5.0,Five Stars,Nice cellphone
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 9, 2016",5.0,"To my great surprise, Samsung made my dream phone","This being my upgrade from a Sony Xperia Advance (a mid-range smartphone from a few years ago, which was also waterproof), it's perhaps not surprising that I am thoroughly impressed by this device. I had looked at the S6 last year, but it wasn't enough to make me want to buy, in particular given the lack of waterproofing, the lack of expandable storage, and the good but not mind-blowing camera. Samsung has made the S7 everything I had been dreaming of but didn't see in the S6, and I just couldn't say no. On paper, the S7 is my perfect phone.And it turns out it's my perfect phone in practice too.The camera, which was the main selling point for me, lives up to the claims. I have been getting great indoor (and outdoor) shots of my 5-year old in action. With my old phone, that was completely impossible since it would take at least 10 seconds to open the camera app and focus. With the S7, I can go from picking up the locked phone to capturing a perfectly focused image in 3 seconds (I caught my son in mid-air as he jumped off a ramp on his scooter). And the colors are almost always very close to what I perceive with my eye, even in some unusual lighting (like midnight in the arctic in spring, or mixed fluorescent light/sunlight in my living room).The screen is gorgeous as everyone knows. Its resolution is riDONKulous.The phone is a good size for me (good balance between being comfortable in the hand, fitting in the pocket, and having a usefully sized screen). I got a slim Spigen Rugged Armor case for it, which makes me feel much more confident in gripping it (in a way, the phone itself is too thin and smooth and glass), and gives the phone a slightly different but still cool look.Of course, it's expensive. But you're really getting a phone, a palm-top computer (which is as fast as any smartphone out there and therefore fast enough to make any Android 3D game or other app run smoothly), an e-reader, and a better-than-point-and-shoot camera all in one.I definitely recommend this device."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 18, 2016",2.0,I wouldn't make this purchase again.,"This international unlocked version doesn't meet the high standard I felt is in all Samsung S7s.  I can't even use the Samsung + plus app on this phone, an app that  was made for supporting this specific phone. The Camara doesn't capture the quality close ups. I'm not sure why and the seller never replied to my 1st email.In addition, I am unable to run an automatic update for nougat 7.0. I have to do a manual update that I am unable to figure out how to download from Samsung.com."

I use anywhere from 40-80 GB of data each month and this phone works great with pretty much any carrier of you don't need volte or WiFi calling. Good build quality and great octa processor. I ordered the G930F but I got the G930FD instead, not that I'm complaining since I like that extra option. Put the incipo dual pro case on this phone for great protection. Love it!

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 5, 2017",4.0,... in the Samsung Galaxy S7 but so far I love it,I have not be using  all the functions  in the Samsung Galaxy  S7 but so far I love it
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 6, 2016",5.0,BEAUTIFUL phone.  12 hours in and everything is working great!,"Just received my new phone, upgrading from a broken Galaxy S5.  So far, I love it...First, the color...  My previous Galaxy was a lovely gold color, but I started to wonder whether I was tired of the gold, and whether I should buy the S7 in a different color.  In the end however, I chose gold again.  The great news is that the S7's gold color is a bit more of a bronze color than a true gold, and LOOKS GREAT!  The previous S5 gold was nice, the S7's gold is much nicer!I paired it with an Acmebox gel clear gold cover (only $5.64) on Amazon.  The cover gives full protection (including a lip around the front edges).  Best of all, the clear cover with a hint of gold in it somehow enhances the already fantastic S7 gold cover.  The result is a VERY EXPENSIVE looking phone, for only another $5.64 in investment.The display looks very clear and crisp.  I've always loved Samsung displays, but this definitely improves on the already great S5 display.The phone takes a ""Nano"" SIM card, vs. the ""Micro"" SIM card in my S5.  This means that you can't just plug your existing SIM card into the new phone.  You may have to wait a few days for your carrier to mail you a new one (or visit a store).  However a lot of Micro SIM cards are actually Nano SIM cards that are Micro sized, and you can just punch the extra micro plastic away to break it down to a Nano size.  In my case, I was intially disappointed when I realized that my SIM card wouldn't fit, until I remembered that TMobile had shipped me a new SIM card that I'd kept but never activated.  Sure enough, the new SIM card was a Nano SIM but with the extra perforated plastic to bring it up to Micro size.  Therefore I was able to have TMobile activate it over the phone, and my phone is now usable.I had a bit of a hard time copying my photos and contacts over to the new phone.  Thankfully Android knows that this is an important issue for new phone users, and the start-up software tries multiple ways to get everything over.  In my case, the NFC approach didn't work at all, and the data cable approach (which comes with your phone - thanks guys!) only pulled over apps.  THe back-up to Google also didn't work (maybe it just took too long).  So I went old-school and just backed everything (photos and contacts) up to the SD card, inserted the old SD card into the new phone, and everything transferred fine.Another thing that initially disappointed me was that the phone did not come pre-loaded with a swipe-style keyboard (there was an option for it in the Settings - but it was greyed out).  However at least 2 free swipe-style keyboards were available from the app. store.  I downloaded both the Google as well as the Swiftkey keyboard.  Of the 2, I prefer the Google keyboard (It feels the most like the one on my S5).  Issue solved!One other odd thing to be aware of... Since the back is no longer removable, the tray for the SD and SIM card is on the top of the phone, and can only be opened by an odd-pin-like device that is included with the phone.  I guess its not a big deal since I seldom need to access the SD card.  But it seems odd that I won't be able to open the tray unless I have the pin on me...Overall, I'm very pleased with my new phone.  ...No regrets (and glad I waited for the S7 vs. getting the no-SD-card S6)."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 19, 2016",5.0,"Beautiful phone, works like a charm","I love, love, love my Galaxy S7. I upgraded from an S6, which I also loved--but the charging port went bad and it would no longer charge. Happily, it was still under warrantee. This is my second unlocked phone. I will say that I chose a UK model, which I hope will be better with its warrantee. Because my S6 was Korean, it was quite a hassle to get any help, though I was finally successful. It is no trouble at all to use this with ATT. In fact, I just took the SIM out of my S6 and installed it in the S7 and voila, my phone was functioning. The transfer was a simple wireless affair of sitting the two phones next to each other and waiting a few minutes. Love the camera, Android Pay, and it works great with my Sonata with Android Auto. And it's gorgeous. No iPhone for me!"

If it is stated somewhere and I missed it then I do apologize. But for now, I see this as pure dishonesty. Spend your cash elsewhere...."

My reason for giving only three stars is due to the disappointment experienced when I spent hours trying to fit two nano-sims in the phone tray. One sim card + micro SD card fits very well but the SD card tray does not appear to be designed for a second sim card. A phone technician confirmed that it can't properly fit two sims, thus it may be for one sim + micro card only. It is disappointing because this was one the main reasons I purchased this expensive phone is for two sims. I travel a lot and require two sims."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 27, 2016",4.0,Good phone but has issues,"Phone is pretty much as advertised, but there are some issues.  I tried to get the Samsung promotion of a free VR unit, but was told, ""Your receipt indicates that you purchased a used and/or refurbished device which is not eligible for this offer"" although the unit I received did appear to be new.  Another thing is I can't seem to find the emergency alerts settings (amber alerts, extreme threats, etc).  Apparently,  buying the international version of the phone does have some disadvantages.  I am pleased with the camera."

It works just fine for two months, then the frezzing screen stars (the cell phone doesnt respond and a softbreset is necessary). First from time to time, then every week. Finally, one day the S7 shutted off and that all folks. 650 dollars to the garbage. The warranty doesnt exist and the seller doesnt even ansewered my emails."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 20, 2017",5.0,As expected,"Great phone! It has many interesting features, is fast and has a lot of room for storage (SD card).I thought I would find it too big, since my previous phone was the Galaxy S4mini (4.3"" screen), but I ended up getting used to 5.1"" screen. The only thing is that if you are going to use a case on the phone, I recommend that you buy one with good adherence. Because of the size of it, you dont get a very good grip while handling it with one hand. I bought the Speck CandyShell Grip case and it works just great.Also the phone was already globally unlocked when I received it, so I could use a SIM card from any country.Been using it for a month now and I have no complaints so far."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 29, 2017",5.0,Great Vendor and product,"What can I say about this vendor. Straight Trading Inc. has gone above and beyond with their customer service. Very responsive ! The issues I had were resolved to my satisfaction very quickly. As to their product, Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone International Version (Gold) [ASIN: B01CJU8FV4], it came in the official Samsung sealed box, See the attached image.The only thing about this phone is the headphone jack. Its not a US standard jack. Its a little bigger so your existing headphones won’t fit. But they include a pair in the box with the phone. You could always use a Bluetooth head set.It is a US/South American version (Region) so it came in Spanish. During set up you will be in Spanish. In the middle of start screen the screen says Español or Seleccionar idiomain or something like that in faint lettering. Just tap/slide a little above that and it will offer other languages.I would not think twice about doing business with Straight Trading Inc. again."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 20, 2017",4.0,Love it!,"Phone works great!! Switched from iPhone and I can guarantee that I won't be going back anytime soon. The only thing was the packaging. I don't know if it was Amazon that package the box or the third party but when the phone arrived nothing was padded and since the galaxy s7 box  only had a magnet to keep the box closed, the phone and everything fell out and was everywhere in the packaging box. Other then that everything was great."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 30, 2016",1.0,Not satisfied.,"40 days after I bought the phone , the calling feature started to break as I couldn't hear anyone on the phone except with th speaker on. And ofcourse with the 30 days limit to return or replace the phone, there is nothing I can do about this. It is ridiculous how we can be tricked so easily with these deals.Everything else is working well, but this type of scam just cancels out everything else.Not satisfied at all."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 4, 2016",5.0,Best smartphone in the market!,"Bought it for my mom to replace an old Nexus. Great phone and my mom loves it! it was very easy to transfer all her content and apps from the Nexus to the Samsung using the adapter and app that Samsung provides. It took about 15 min of setting it up and transferring all the data.No special activation was required - I insert the SIM card, turned it on and it works like a charm. Keep in mind this phone uses the nano-sim so if you have an older smartphone, ask your carrier to provide you a new SIM. They should provide this at no charge."

Two days ago it stopped working, the only thing I can see is a black screen and a blue light at the top of the phone and that is all. I tried to reset or restart the phone, but nothing worked. Unfortunately, I have just read the comments and learned that many people had the same problem. So if you are reading comments considering buying this phone. My recommendation is clear, don't buy it. And additionally, I contact with Amazon, and they told me that there is nothing that they can do."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 18, 2016",5.0,S7 is a saweet phone.,I ordered the S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G930F - Black Oynx. After contacting the seller to make sure it was a authentic international they assured me it was. When I first received it I looked for the original box and it was. I took the phone out and turned it on to make sure it was real and not a fake. It was just like he said it was a authentic  international S7.I have had the phone just over 2 weeks now and love it. It takes awesome pictures even in low light. I really like the video quality. You can even do slo motion or hyper speed. I am still learning all this phone can do. I would suggest getting a 128 gig or bigger sd card and a cover because it does show fingerprints and is a bit slippery. I am very happy with the phone and the seller!
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 19, 2016",5.0,VERY VERY HAPPY,I'm very happy with the phone Its exactly how it was described

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 10, 2016",5.0,Excellent!,Great product!
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 26, 2016",4.0,"Fast, Sleek, Disappointing lack of an IR blaster","Alright, I got my s7 around late march,  (yes, just in time to miss every special offer with the gear vr) and I have to say, I absolutely love this phone. It is, as expected, the FASTEST phone I have ever had, considering it has better processing speeds than normal computers did a few years ago, and it looks GREAT. Yes, they did come with android upgrades in general, but Samsung has made MASSIVE improvements to their UI, ease of access connection speeds, and an amazing screen just overall. However, there are some issues that I have with it, things I wish were included, and just overall some comments about the phone and features1) BATTERY LIFE. Now, I understand that people have been commending it for its battery life, but I personally find it running out all too often. It seems that every flagship phone of this generation has been jumping on the Quad-HD bandwagon, and the s7 is no different. Yes, it looks slightly better, but, according to logic and IN MY EXPERIENCE, it drains battery life WAY faster than the max 1080p screen of old. One of the main differences between this device, and the LG G3 ,the flagship that basically pioneered the Quad-HD phone space, is that the s7 does not have a removable battery. On top of that, there is the adaptive display, which unlike 2k, (Quad-HD) makes a huge difference, making the screen extremely vibrant and attractive. HOWEVER, this drains a ton of battery too in my experience; thankfully you can turn it off. Also, is it just me, or does the battery DRAIN faster when charged with fast charge, too.2) PHYSICAL GLASS. Alright, I'm going to be perfectly honest, most of this is more of a pro than a con, but I would just like to comment on the corning gorilla glass 4 that this phone has both on front and back. The glass on the front I'd say is pretty great. I have for some reason treated this phone worse than I have with any other, but it's held up amazingly. There are minimal scratches and even after a freak Pokemon Go accident that would've completely shattered the screen of any phone I've ever had, it was left with a small CHIP in the right-hand corner. Yes, a CHIP. Now, I know by the way I said it, it sounds like a bad thing, but I thought it was amazing. I mean, I threw that thing HARD, and I think, the fact that it chipped rather than shatter into a million pieces was a REALLY good thing(picture of crack attached[if you can even see it]). Now for the back. I hate that it has a glass back. Yes, it looks nice, and yes, I always have a case protecting it anyway, but for those who don't believe in cases, and like many users, hate the active series, I don't care what kind of glass you put on the back, it will not be as durable as a GOOD metal back.3) Lack Of An IR Blaster. Now I know this was an unusual feature to be integrated into a smartphone in the first place, but I really do miss the IR blaster. It was so very convenient to be able to replace every remote in your house without separate, $100-300 hardware. Yes, it was a little finicky, but I think that calls for improvement, not SCRAPPING IT ENTIRELY.  I get it though, it was a thing that no average user really used, or even KNEW about, and that made it not worth even including because it raised the production value, but I LIKED IT. It was VERY NICE.4) WATERPROOFING. This one is most definitely a pro. I quite like the waterproofing of the s7. As I said, I have treated this phone worse than any I have ever had, and that includes taking it places where I thought it might get really wet, like I mean soaking. Well, it has held up amazingly so far, accidental drops in sinks and similar things proved to be absolutely nothing to this phone, and I have tested it in the very hot shower with great results.5) SAMSUNG PAY. Alright, I'll say it, I love Samsung Pay. It is so convenient, and hilarious blowing cashiers' minds wherever you go. Although, there are some issues with this too, however pretty minor and some easily fixable. The few issues that I have with samsung pay are:A) the lack of support for banks and credit cards that are not partnered with Samsung. I understand that this could be for a few reasons, either some banks are too small, neither are nor wish to be associated with Samsung, and for security reasons, but that doesn't change that you just can't use some cards on samsung play that you would very much like to use, and that I believe that Samsung could fix this by pushing harder to partner with every bank they can, even if it means setting up the systems for them.B) The difficulty involved with the use of Samsung Pay. This includes the fact that getting the card to read is pretty difficult, and even if you know how to do it perfectly, sometimes it takes a couple tries, and the ignorance of just about every snarky cashier on Earth, not letting you even attempt to pay with Samsung Pay, because ""they don't have the system set up.""Overall, as I said, this is an amazing phone, great choice for a flagship, but there are some issues, missed opportunities, and good things that stood out about the galaxy s7 that I thought were worth mentioning in this review. And I realize this was probably a very negative sounding review in contrast to my ratings, but I really do love this phone, I just think the good things don't really need explainingNOTE: This is my own written review, HOWEVER, I previously posted it on the Samsung website as an entry to a sweepstakes. Also, I did not purchase the phone from amazon, nor did I purchase mine unlocked, so I cannot speak to the compatibility of this unlocked item with different sim cards, but I felt the need to post it here, as it is the exact same product, and this is the listing directly from Samsung.PICTURE: The chip on my screen mentioned above"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 31, 2016",3.0,Samsung S7  good and curiously deficient.....both ....,The charger is  way too complicated....and using European plugs  and  three different adapters to get it charged is a curious way to  sell a phone....

The camera quality is great and when adding an online storage option you never have to worry about space.  I bought this phone because they put the SD card slot back which allowed me to put a 128GB card in to give more space.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is currently looking to upgrade.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 26, 2017",3.0,Selfie camera problem,"If you intend to take quality selfies with this phone then think again.I noticed the first selfie seemed smooth without any details and immediately tried to turn off Beauty Mode. After no luck still, I Googled for 'S7 blurry front camera' and found others with the same problem as me.It turns out that the front camera is not focusing on subjects right in front of it but to infinity instead. The result is sharp backgrounds and out-of-focus foreground subjects with a smooth look.Apparently the issue only exists on S7's made in Vietnam and not the ones coming from Korea but I'm not sure how to tell which one you're getting.Even though I don't take selfies, I ended up returning the phone because I see it as defective.Besides this one issue, I still think the phone and the rear camera is superb."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 26, 2016",4.0,Would be perfect if the keyboard was like the US version,"Great except for the keyboard isn't normal. No way to get the symbols above the letters in your keyboard unless you download an app, but in the app I used, the layout was still a little weird and it drove me crazy. Also, you can't see when people have read your texts (if they have an S7 and have read receipts on, then it should) also, you can't see the dots when people with S7 are typing back.  I ended up returning this one because of these things, and I just went to my t mobile store and got the US version. The US version does seem to get a lot hotter though, so that's one plus about the international version since it was much cooler. I knew this before purchasing the international version and still bought it because these features didn't matter to me, but it's good information to know that Samsung pay and VOLTE do not work on the international version."

Everything was shipped on time and my phone came in some good package so it was not damaged. I highly recommend this phone to the public because it is quite cheaper than what the carriers offer such as Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, or Sprint. This phone works great on all four major American phone carriers and even the tinier carriers such as Virgin, Cricket, or more. Thumbs up to this phone."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 30, 2016",5.0,This phone is just ridiculous in such a good way...,"Excellent phone especially considering how much you can gut and alter the software performance even without root. Plus the Exynos processor runs SO SMOOTH (supposedly much moreso than the US Snapdragon phones).BE AWARE: If you want one with Samsung Pay you are SOL for the moment. These are Panamanian region phones (or at least the one I recieved was) that are allowed to work in the US. You will get updates when that region gets updates from Samsung (such as the Samsung Pay rollout). Trying to change this /might/ trip KNOX (flashing a different region's ROM I think will do this, but I am unsure) and leave you unable to get Samsung Pay anyway. That said, that is literally the only reason I can think of not to get this phone. The operating system (Touchwiz) is more full-featured than normal Android and the mild bit of Samsung bloat preinstalled can be disabled with the right apps such as Package Disabler Pro.I rooted it and have no complaints. If you want a marginally faster phone with mildly clunkier peripherals and something like $100 - $200 cheaper then get a OnePlus 3. Otherwise, just turn off or speed up phone animations from the developer settings section and you will have a comparably snappy phone anyway.You can't really lose with this phone. It has some of the best peripherals AND is neck and neck with the best Android phones in terms of software. Or get the Snapdragon Edge version for a larger battery. Unless you have brand loyalties then the best phones you can buy are probably the Galaxy S7/S7 Edge/7 Note, OnePlus 3, or the upcoming Apple phones (without diving into the whole gimmicky market of 8GB Asian phones that may run fast but have other large weakpoints).OnePlus 3: best internals, fairly good externalsUpcoming iPhone: probably yet another super snappy masterpiece stuck in the Apple's software market. With an OS specifically tailored to the hardware it runs on its really REALLY hard for any Android phone to beat an iPhone in speed. Apple people will love this. Kudos to them.Galaxy S7/S7 Edge/Note 7 (Exynos): pretty much Android's iPhone by this point. Not QUITE as snappy but you get the whole market of Android apps which is staggeringly large by this point. User is less restricted by bulls*** lioe thay imposed by Apple like Apple's music services deleting songs not downloaded through the service for example.Anyway, started detouring. Great phone. If you can afford the premium, do not want an Apple phone, do not want Samsung Pay (at least immediately), and are not perturbed by it running oh-so-marginally slower than a OnePlus 3 then this is your phone (especially if you are willing to do RAM/battery tweaks). No regrets."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 2, 2017",5.0,Worth every penny!!,I've had this phone for about 2 years & I still love it!! The camera is amazing & I love the swipe keyboard. Also great phone for us clumsy people :3 dropped it without case or screen protector more times than I can count & not even a scratch on the screen :O
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 26, 2016",5.0,Great Phone!!!!!,"The packaging was great, brand new phone. The phone works great! Definitely an upgrade from the HTC One M9 that I had. The camera takes super great pictures and the display on the phone is A+. I could not recommend this phone more! It does require a sim card, so if you have AT&T it'll work just fine. The battery is also an upgrade from my HTC! My HTC would take long to charge and died quickly. This Galaxy S7 lasts me the whole day and charges very fast. Overall a great phone, definitely should by!"

And this one is also. Works perfectly fine!The only thing that annoys me about mine is that in the ""about device"" section in settings it says United Arab Emirates and not USI don't know much about android and so far it has not affected me. I hope it stays like that also when I return to Europe."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 24, 2016",4.0,"Not quite equivalent of US T-Mobile phone, beware","For folks in the US to be aware of, the phone doesn't work with WiFi calling. This appears to be a feature that is only included with phones directly from T-Mobile. Visual Voicemail works, but it took me a little while to get it working. Fast network speeds seemed to be indicated with an ""H+,"" rather than ""4GLTE."" I haven't tested to see whether it is equivalent speed.  I presume it's a European symbology. The display is very nice, and the apps work as expected. The camera is particularly nice. It's also very slippery in my hand. I miss the grippy back of the S5. Finally, I haven't bothered getting a screen protector, since the front of the screen is curved, so normal screen protectors don't work. The glass seemed pretty tough, though. The charger uses the European plug style, but it comes with an adapter. The adapter makes it quite bulky compared to the US plug, but it's not that big of a deal, as long as you're not trying to plug it in behind a cabinet, desk, etc."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 11, 2016",5.0,Great phone,Hi. I received the phone today.  I was nicely suprised when I found out that it was shipped almost right after I ordered!!! It came the day it should.I'm using it with attractive go phone and it started working right after inserting sim card. after few hours I really like it. It seems like it doesn't  have lte just 4g and sometimes  H+ but it still works. It doesn't have Samsung pay but I was expecting it as I did some research. I'm not sure about battery  life.  In 3 hours it went from 52 to 11% and I have battery saving on but I will see. I will dry to drain it and that charge it all the way. I will come back with more updates.Mine was sold by wireless everything. They  really send it out fast!!!

One downside, which is a big one, is the speaker is very tinny. Sounds like a blown car speaker. Absolutely no bass whatsoever. BUT... it's not THAT bad. Considering the phone is waterproof! Rate 7/10. Near perfect. I expect something crazy for the S8 from what this phone can do. You won't be disappointed. LTE speeds in USA is 5/1 with AT&T. I have the international unlocked version. It was 100$ cheaper lol."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 14, 2016",1.0,Warranty of broken phone may not work at all!,"I was very surprised with this order and cannot recommend it to anyone. The warranty can be very tricky when the phone is broken. Even if you are willing to send the phone by international mail to repair.The real first contact with water at Niagara falls (rain and drops of the fall) lead to oxidation of the main board and battery (based on Samsung Czech Republic findings). So, the repair is very expensive. Really tricky for the phone with IP68 certification (dust proof and water resistant over 1.5 meter and 30 minutes). I tried to contact the seller  to give me some advises how to repair it under warranty. They simply stop to respond to my first set of questions. Their response in another attempt was unbelievable "" Water damaged items are not covered under any manufacturer warranties.""I am still waiting for the response from Samsung Czech Republic. Hopefully they will give me better answers."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 18, 2016",1.0,Phones had more negatives than positives,Very disappointed by the phone overall. The price was 630ish on Amazon better on here than the retail price at store at the time. However after over a year of use I found various problems.1st and the price dropping dramatically I regret this purchase.2nd I dislike the glass unlike everyone else. It's not very durable and HATE THE CURVED EDGE!!! This is not the S7 edge either just the standard S7. This is my major issue that made me never want to buy another Samsung Galaxy. This phone doesn't allow any screen protector to work properly. The factory will fix it for for a small price of 200 (ridiculous).3rd the screens adhesive comes off after several months of use. It started on the corner and continuously spread half an inch. It looked bad enough that I payed to get it fixed. So much for water proof4th 2 replacement screen's had damaged lcds after I replaced it. So much for finding a functioning replacement screen. Wasted my time trying to fix a manufacturing defect that shouldn't have occurred in the first placeThe only good thing about this phone was the camera. Which after all the hassle I found its not worth it. If your going to buy a phone for the camera get a Sony. I'm not a sponsor or get paid but no one can compare to Sony s camera in my opinion

I would recommend getting a phone case cause this phone is very slippery and you will drop it alot.

The SIM/MicroSD card slot isn't fragile but not really firm either - We don't take it out much, just need to be careful. The package had international wall charger, however the seller included a US socket converter. Looks new - and have new information about warranty. The phone's Model / Serial / IMEI number is on the sticker on the back of the phone. Find the 7th and 8th digit of IMEI and that will give you the phone's country of origin. Mine was 08 which is Germany. Went to Samsung Germany page, and was able to register my phone. It confirms 2 yr warranty. Overall its been a great experience. Will come back in 6 months to report usage."

Started using it in July and it worked great for 2 weeks - and then stopped.First the EMMC chip (flash chip) fried and then after I got that fixed (for about 132$) the power management IC went as well.Amazon is not willing to take the product back because more then 30 days have passed, not for a full or even partial refund and they are not willing to exchange the product for a new one either.I called Samsung and they can't register the  phones IMEI number because it's an internationally sourced phone so they won't help me either.Basically I'm out over 700$ for a phone that does not work.My recommendation - if you want to buy a Samsung device, buy one that is NOT internationally sourced, that way if there are problems, you can contact Samsung in the US and have them take care of it.UPDATE: Aamazon gave me a full refund for the device and I am returning it to them. I still think it would be better to get a phone that is not internationally sourced.Samsung Galaxy S7 Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - Internationally sourced (EU/LATAM) version  G930F- Platinum Gold"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 27, 2017",5.0,DOES work on cricket,"This listing contains an error. This phone DOES work on cricket and I have been using it on cricket since August 2016. It does not have LTE bands but it does have 4G GSM bands. Cricket caps data at 8mbps down speed though, which is in 4G range and not LTE anyway, so that didn't really matter. I notice no speed issues against my boyfriend's cricket USA model.I love this phone for multiple reasons. I work for a Verizon retailer and I very much dislike the amount of bloatware on carrier phones. This phone has no carrier bloatware and very little Samsung bloat.It was recently updated to nougat and it's even snappier than ever. Rarely every has lag issues. And things load even faster than before.I travel a lot so I needed a phone that could work in Europe. I popped a Swisscom sim in this guy last time I was in Europe and I had no issues. Piece of cake.It is waterproof. I run mine under the faucet at least once a day to get the oils off. Keeps the phone looking nicer and the germs at bay.I paired this guy with a UAG case and QMadix liquid glass screen protector. If you haven't tried those yet I highly suggest it. It fills in the pores of the glass and is as strong as sapphire, except you don't even know anything is there. I put it on both the front and back of the phone. It also keeps fingerprints at a minimum and is easier to clean.The camera on this phone blows my iPhone away. I have blown these photos up to 20"" and they rival my Nikon d5000. Amazing.My only complaint is that it doesn't group text. I'm not sure if that's from it being international version or what, since my boyfriend's cricket version s7 doesn't have that issue, but that's minor. Things just come in under the specific contact and not in one giant thread."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 10, 2016",1.0,Repeatedly locking now on Android updates.,"Original review: Just received today, and just a couple minor glitches, but am otherwise expecting this phone to be as great as promised.  So just a few comments.1.  Do charge the battery before first use. And, yes, charging is fast.2.  This phone takes a NANO sim card.  That's smaller than my prior sim, so necessitated a trip into a local AT&T store for a new sim.  Which was relatively quick, after a wait, and the phone, yes, unlocked phone, readily worked fine.3.  Prior to heading into AT&T, though, I was able to complete most of the initial phone set up using my local Wi-Fi connection.  Neat.  But I did notice that the phone felt a bit warm during this process.  I now have the phone in a case, and no longer feels warm, though that could be somewhat due to the case.  But after initial, I didn't really notice my warmth from the phone either.4.  Battery remaining % is displayed right on the lock screen.  Nice.  But battery life does seem to fall off fairly quickly.  But will let this battery discharge and recharge a few times, and then see where things stand.5.  My granddaughter asked why I got a smaller phone, but I'm hoping that with this higher resolution to not miss my former larger phone.  Time will tell.6.  My biggest con?  The screen covering the speaker located on the bottom edge is applied at an angle and appears damaged and crunched.  Speaker is fine, best that I can tell, and so I am not interested in returning for a small cosmetic.  Still, I'd have preferred that QC had caught.  So dinging one star.Update Oct 2, 22016.  I'm thinking I made a real mistake shelling out big bucks for this phone.  It has now locked up five time in the last three weeks, getting very hot each time. So far, it has come back each time after letting battery die over 24 hours and then recharging.  All started with an Android OS update.  And did again today as I was hoping this new update would fix the last one.  No such luck.  I'll consider myself lucky if the phone is not bricked.  Thinking seriously of trying a custom ROM, as what have I got to lose."

Won't bother restating the many reviews online. One thing to watch for is that in the USA AT&T's support for unlocked devices seems to be crap. If you have any issue connecting your device to AT&T and they can't fix it in 5 minutes, they won't do anything else to help you. That said, the device did connect to AT&T and to T-Mobile. LTE speeds on T-Mobile were about 3 times faster than on AT&T. Switching to T-Mobile for the speed, better plans, and better support for unlocked devices."

Watch the video for my impressions and thoughts, and feel free to post questions - I'll answer if I can!*****U.S. buyers please note that the Galaxy S7 G930F model is an international phone.  It will work just fine in the U.S. BUT YOU LIKELY HAVE NO WARRANTY COVERAGE!!!  I would strongly urge you to consider purchasing a 3rd party warranty if you buy this for use in the U.S. (feel free to contact Samsung to confirm warranty coverage or lack thereof).  My last phone was the LG G4 international model, and it died after 9 months.  To my surprise LG would not repair the phone & explained that they do not offer warranty coverage to US customers who purchased an international phone.

The quick-response feature is wonderful. Pair this with the Samsung quick-charge pad and never plug it in again. I came from an S5 and there is a noticeable difference in speed and processing power. The camera shutter speed is lightning-fast: instantaneous. Haven't seen it in low-light or concerts yet. I can't find any faults with this other than the battery is't removable anymore but that wasn't worth a ""star"" to me. This runs on a nano sim card, which the S5 had a micro sim chip. At&T gave me one (SIM) for free when I dropped in and gave them my phone IMEI. Enjoy this phone because Samsung got it right... again!"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 7, 2016",5.0,Galaxy S7 - the new wonder by Samsung :),"I was waiting for this new wonder by Samsung and atlast I got it in my hand. Out of Black, white , Gold and Silver I chose the gold one. No doubt Samsung has again shown its creativity in its new launch Galaxy S7.I will start with not so impressive points of this new tech wonder-1) Similar look to S6- It looks so similar to older version S6 in design. At least a new version should have differences from its predecessors not only by features but also by look. Both of them are same by size, look , height , width. Only slight differences are there by look. S6 is more flat at the back whereas S7 has curved panel.The rear camera in s6 sticks out a bit whereas in S7 the camera is more flat.2) No Type c USB - I will miss my nexus Type c usb connector in S7 which I really enjoy in my google nexus 5X. S again I will be missing my fast charging here which is most needed when you are in a hurry and want to get your phone atleast half charged within a couple of minutes.3) No 3D touch- I love 3D touch of my iPhone 6S plus which I will be missing in this S7.Now the best and most impressive sides of S7 are -1) Better camera than S6-  In spite of the significant megapixel difference in camera between S6 and S7 ( S6 has 16 MP rear camera where as S7 has 12 mp rear camera ) I would say the camera is much better than S6 . Pictures comes solid in S7 and you will not have a chance to think about the megapixel difference.2) Waterproof phone- Yeah, Samsung has created the wonder fully waterproof which is savior to those worries if your phone accidentally gets dropped in water.3) Better battery performance - Combo of 3000 mah battery and android marshmallow featuring long lasting battery will make S7 horse of a long race.4) Micro SD card support- It supports Micro SD card which is a win win over S6.I am using this phone and have no complaints still now and pretty happy with my golden S7."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 25, 2017",4.0,This phone is really nice it works well and is pretty fast,This phone is really nice it works well and is pretty fast. But after looking at the one-star reviews I'm hoping that this phone doesn't have any problems especially because it has no warranty. Another thing about the phone is that it's really slippery even with the case that I bought. It's not as grippy as my old phone but it sure does work better with a really nice back and front camera. I will keep you guys updated about the performance of the phone and if I'm running into any problems after weeks/months hopefully the phone still works after months because this is a really nice phone.

Now it will not even charge and will not power on.This is clearly a defective model and worse yet, there is a 1 yr warranty listed on the item's page but it's a lie!  I called Samsung and they said it cannot be serviced in the US and likewise, Amazon said they will do nothing.This seller is selling a bad phone and Amazon is doing a bad job protecting the consumer - regardless, I will find a way to get my refund or replacement device even though this process has been very crooked on Amazon's part."

However, if you're getting the international G930F, know that Samsung pay won't work and Android Pay will be limited.  In addition, if you're expecting faster updates from Samsung, just know they have the G930F extremely fragmented by country and specific firmware to each country... so not all will receive updates as fast as you might expect for a ""carrier free"" device.

The screen was completely inked out. They initially wanted to blame UPS but there was no apparent damage to the box or packaging. They finally owned up to the damage but was completely unhelpful with going about resolving the issue. They had the audacity to say normally I would be charged to fix the screen THEY damaged. I am completely done with Samsung and all their products that apparently either malfunctioning or blowing up."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 27, 2016",5.0,Good experience with AT&T network,"I'm not reviewing the GS7. It's a great phone. I'm very happy with it. I'm reviewing the seller. I received a new sealed GS7 for Italy I believe (TIM) is the carrier. plugged the micro sim from my AT&T GS6 and went through the usual startup process. Everything went perfect. I set the language to english and I'm using AT&T's 4g LTE network. I didn't have to add any AP names or anything. It just worked. It's seems to be just as good or bad as the GS6 (AT&T branded) that I was using before. I was also able to uninstall all the TIM apps, which has not been my experience with AT&T and other US carriers. I can usually disable most of them but not uninstall completely. If I bought this from AT&T it would have cost about $200 more (crazy that the price is still the same as when it was released since it will likely be replaced in 3 months with the GS8) and I would have been forced to reprovision a new sim card for some reason which would take time which is the same as more money and I would have a bunch of AT&T apps taking up memory."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 22, 2016",5.0,I love this phone,"I love this phone, I got the gold one yesterday and my brother got the silver. Honestly...from a distance they both look silver, but up close you can tell the difference. The only issues I have is when fast charging, the phone gets VERY hot...it's expected but still....also....keep this phone in a case and keep a screen protector on at all times....because this phone collects fingerprints. Other than that...no complaints thus far...the camera is an AMAZING upgrade from my S5...also I was pleasantly surprised that it has front flash. I live in the Caribbean(SVG)....phone works absolutely fine here....whatsapp messages were coming through as soon as i put my sim card in and turned on my mobile data. Highly reccomend :)"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 10, 2016",5.0,This phone is Beautiful! The materials they put into it are top ...,"(I did purchase this phone from this page and decided to do a quick review of it)This phone was everything I could have asked for. I always had this predisposition that the Samsung phones were made with lower quality materials, but I was dead wrong. This phone is Beautiful! The materials they put into it are top notch and in my personal opinion this device looks and feels much better than the iPhones!When I first got I was worried because I was switching from Apple to Android, which can be a pretty daunting change. BUT the transition did not seem to take long at all. I got into the phone pretty quickly and was doing my normal daily tasks in no time.It is sad that I had to give up FaceTime but I feel like it was worth it and my friends quickly adapted and started calling me on Skype or Oovoo instead.Unlike the name says, this phone did actually come with some type of warranty I believe. On the box there was a ""24 month warranty"" sticker,.. So I am assuming that means I have a warranty!I also was curious to see which phone is faster (the iPhone 6s Plus vs the Samsung Galaxy S7) so I ran a few easy tests. In getting into apps, the Samsung got in just a hair faster. In loading webpages, the Samsung again beat the iPhone just by a hair.The camera on the Samsung is by far the superior camera when there is ample amount of lighting but in low light, I would give it to the iPhone. The front-facing camera, works the same way. In low light the iPhone wins, but with enough light, the Samsung does better.There are many really cool customization options on the Android software that you would have to jailbreak your iPhone to do, and with the type of person I am I feel like the Android software works better for me. On the other hand, Android may be more confusing to use. Things are not always quite right there where you want them to be and you have have to search for them. BUT Android helps you out with this with search bars when they are convenient.Overall this device is everything I could have asked for. I really enjoy it and I hope I can continue enjoying it for as long as possibly"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 4, 2016",5.0,Samsung at Their Best,"DesignSamsung's phones are very similar to the S6-Note 5 range from last year. The new models still are made of glass (it is Corning Gorilla Glass 4, which is very high quality and durable). The looks are still fantastic and the black, gold, and silver titanium colors looks premium. The colors no longer have hidden colors that show up in sunlight, as the black color is simply just a jet black and same for the gold. The silver titanium has a mirror like finish to it, so it is still reflective.The Galaxy S7 brings the welcome return of dust and water resistance. It is now IP68 certified and is water resistant up to 3 feet and 30 minutes. I find this to be a great return to form and something that should be mandatory for all phones moving forward.CameraThe 12MP camera on the back is very good, but I honestly feel like it’s not as great as the Galaxy S6’s camera. Samsung actually reduced the megapixel count and I feel like it shows. Samsung has stated that due to improved image software and better pictures in low light conditions, it is a worthy tradeoff, but I don’t feel like it was worth it completely. It comes with OIS to help with image stabilization and the camera loads extremely fast. You can load it by clicking on the icon on the home or lock screens or my favorite way: by double clicking the home button. The delay is less than a second which is impressive. The images look great on the screen, but unlike the 2015 models, you lose more detail when enlarging them on the phone and on a computer screen/when printing them out.The 5MP front facing camera is still very good. It has a wide field of vision and takes stellar pictures. It also has a front facing flash which is nice and helpful in low light conditions.DisplayAnother year later and it is still hard to find a better looking display. It’s a 5.1-inch screen and 577 pixels per inch, which creates an unbelievably great looking screen. It is bright, detailed, and showcases amazing color accuracy.AudioThe audio is good and loud. I do wish the Galaxy S7 would take cues from some of their competition and utilize front facing stereo speakers. When holding the phone in landscape mode and watching a video on say Netflix, it is a little hard to hear at times due to the fact that the sound is only coming out the right or left side only.BatteryThe battery has been bumped up to a 3,000 mAh battery and it shows. The battery life is superior to last year’s model and does a great job of getting me through the day. The turbo charging is still excellent, but the wireless charging also had some issues with staying connected, and I’m using the official Samsung wireless charger.FunctionalityThe Always on Display function is nice and useful at times, but I have found it to also be distracting due to one flaw. If you have your phone on your desk at work or by your computer, it is a distraction because the clock will jump around the screen every few minutes. This is due to Samsung wanting to reduce the risk of screen burn in, where if an image is in the same spot all the time, it runs the potential of frying out that particular spot on the screen. That is all well and good, but ideally I would use the Always on Display to silently know if I receive an important text or call. When the screen jumps around, I find my eye wanders to it every time not knowing if it’s lighting up to show a new text or if it’s just simply shifting around.The themes option out of the Samsung store is great and has grown a lot since last year. It allows you to completely customize how you want your backgrounds, keyboard, text messages, and overall aesthetic to look. It is a bit unfortunate to see more and more of the themes to no longer be free like they were when the theme store was first launched.The phone itself works well, although at times there is an issue with lag and app crashes. It was running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and everything worked nicely for the most part. Samsung has gone back to using a Snapdragon processor after spending last year utilizing their own chipset. The Snapdragon 820 processor of this year is incredibly fast and the 820 is marked improvement over the 810 which would get too hot and stutter at times. This coupled with the 4GB of RAM makes the phone blaze through almost any task with minimal issues. It is among the fastest and most reliable phones I have ever used.  This, combined with the 4GB of RAM the S7 has, means that the phone is up for any task with amazing speed.The fingerprint sensor still feels not as fast and accurate as some of the better options out there. It is accurate I’d say 75% of the time, but sometimes it can be very finicky which is frustrating due to the fact that it’s meant to be both fast and more secure.With Android, you get more customizability in terms of launchers, themes, widgets and colors than you do with Apple’s IOS, but you also have to wait longer for updates, have potentially more issues with security, and have an app store that isn’t as fleshed out or monitored as Apple’s is. Android definitely is for those who want more customizability and are adept/willing to do a little bit more tinkering with it to set it up just the way they want it.I enjoy Touchwiz and the added options Samsung provides. It allows for things like an improved Calendar from stock Android (it shows more information on the month view), added customization tweaks and a multi window to be multitask, although I still can’t see why a basic app like the calculator can’t work there in landscape mode.I am very glad to see the expandable storage options of the past return. It is convenient to be able to improve the storage to 256GB which should be more than enough for most people and the 32GB base is great as well.If you would like to read more of my reviews, please check out: smartphonehaven.com"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 23, 2016",5.0,PERFECT? LETS SEE.,"Before the S7, I had a note 5, I've still kept it around but it has been 2 days and I thought I should give you a brief review of my first impressions,Improvements over the Note 5 -1) The screen looks much better and even more vibrant. My secondary phone is an iPhone and it is nowhere near the vibrancy of the Samsung display but if you're playing a video on youtube at 720p resolution on the S7 and Note 5, the S7 is at least 20% better. I could not believe the difference so I had my wife do a double take on it as well and she confirmed its far better.2) The sound is less muffled and a lot louder, audible - its still like a loud mini-speaker but it is definitely a step in the right direction3) The battery size on this phone is 3000mah and the screen is 5.1""  and since the new processor is more power efficient, this basically translates to a better battery life. Of course I can't expect the same over the coming months since Samsung hasn't really nailed their power efficiency over the course of a possible android upgrade...what I am saying is when Android N comes around, I dont know if the power will still be good. My experience between the Lollipop and the Android marshmallow upgrade was not so good (on note 5) but for now the bottom line is I am getting well over 30 hours of battery with moderate to heavy usage4) The Note 5 camera was lovely and the Samsung S7 is even better. The 5.1"" size actually helps in taking better pictures since screen is much easier to grab. The quality of the images is even better and though on paper it's been downsized to 12megapixel instead of 16mp..it actually looks a whole lot better now. Also the video is very clear, supposing you're shooting trees in a moving car, the backdrop is sharper and the sky looks utterly beautiful. iPhone is no match in the camera department, samsung is running away with it. I still maintain the note 5 had a brilliant camera.5) Added functionality with SD card storage makes this phone a winner6) It is water proof. Im scared to try it but its good to know I don't have to sulk when I accidentally drop beer on my phone or run home when its raining or not use it if Im out swimming or in the shower. BIG PLUSCONS -1) It seems noticeably heavy even though I am coming from the Note 5. Maybe because it is smaller and thicker. but this is something i can get used to.2) Also you'll need a case because these phones are slippery and too beautiful. My note 5 has a crack on its back so I'm not taking chances with S7.3) The front facing camera on these phones are good but I prefer the iPhone 6s camera for selfies.4) Samsung doesn't come close to iPhone when it comes to sending emails with inbuilt email management system. Often times my emails are in outbox as people are asking me where is my reply to their email. Embarrassing problem.5) the browser is good but it doesn't compare to the speed and readability of Safari...Conclusion - After just a day or two of use, I am going to give the phone a 9/10Verdict - Buy this over any other phone. But definitely get a case."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 28, 2017",1.0,If you're like me and have very large fingers then this makes ...,"I bought one of these a year ago, and never have I regretted a phone purchase so badly.To start with the part that will bother most people, the keyboard on my phone is extremely laggy, as in I will type about two words before one shows up. If you're like me and have very large fingers then this makes typing quite frustrating.More annoyingly to me, and perhaps to some others as well, is the level of bloatware installed on this phone and Samsung's awful attitude regarding any expressed desire from a user to have it removed. This becomes a problem at its worst when many of these bloatware apps have background processes that prevent you from getting the best battery life you could out of the phone, entirely so software you don't want can waste resources.Getting to the battery, the life was excellent for one month and then it went downhill rapidly. Now I carry a charging cable with me to work so I can plug the phone in when it inevitably gets low on power around lunch time. Considering it sits by my desk largely unused, this is inexcusable. As someone who likes to go for long hikes I want something that I can trust to hold a charge all day so I can take pictures while I'm out, instead I get something that requires me to carry a portable power pack.Lastly, there's a bizarre phenomenon I can only describe as phantom touch, where my finger gets near a part of the screen and it reacts as though I touched it. Once again, I have large fingers that make precision with a touch screen difficult and this does nothing to help with that."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 12, 2016",1.0,Product not as described.,"This ""factory unlocked international version""  came with a big sticker on the box saying it needed an American SIM card.(Update: I was lucky — I was able to borrow a US nano-SIM from a friend, make a five-minute phone call to it, and after that the phone does seem to be working so far with my own SIM card.)"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"February 18, 2017",5.0,This is a great phone,"Build - The S7 has a really premium build with gorilla glass 4 on the front and back with a metal frame holding everything together. On the front you have a fantastic 5.1” amoled display, fingerprint sensor, capacitive buttons, notification light and a 5mp camera. On the back you have the 12mp camera, flash, and heart rate sensor.. On the right side you have the power button with the volume rockers on the left side. On the top you have your sim tray and micro sd slot and on the bottom you have your micro-usb port, speaker, and headphone jack. I wish the headphone jack always on the top but I don't mind since I mainly use Bluetooth headphones anyway.Specs -  android 6.0 snapdragon 820 4gb of ram 12 mp rear cam with OIS, 5mp front cam, 2k amoled display.Software & performance - The phone shipped with 6.0 but samsung promises a 7.0 update is on the way. Being a flagship samsung device you get the full touchwiz experience with things like an always on display, themes, different power saving modes, and samsung pay.Front facing fingerprint reader is not as accurate for me as ones placed on the back. But that could be how I hold the phone. Considering the S7 is rocking the Snapdragon 820, any app I opened, opened quickly and performed well, even 3d intensive games like dead trigger 2. With 4gb I was able to multitask between apps with no problem at all. The screen on the S7 is outstanding. It is easily bright enough to see on sunny days, and being that it is an amoled panel means that it has vibrant colors and deep blacks. This also means that the display only lights up the pixels it needs to use so features like the always on display doesnt use too much battery.Camera - The S7 has a 12mp rear camera with optical image stabilization. While it has less MP than the s6 did It also has a larger sensor so it can take in more light. This allows the camera on the S7 to take amazing pictures during the day or night, capturing a lot of detail and having pretty accurate colors even with HDR+ on.Battery - It has a 3000mah battery. It will get you through a full day with light usage but will require you to top it off if you use your phone a lot but it does include fast charging so you shouldnt have to wait too long for your battery to be charged. Gets warm while charging and during heavy usage."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 28, 2016",1.0,No one moved,"I don't know why it was said that someone moved because I'm still at the current address, I might not have been home at that time but I didn't move."

It has built in advertisements that pop up over your screen like facebook messenger pop ups. Originally I could get rid of them by opening and closing, which already pissed me off. As of today they aren't going away even then. I hate this and would rather get a iPhone than deal with this bs again."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 22, 2016",1.0,One Star,Hello no
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 13, 2016",1.0,TERRIBLE SELFIE CAMERA,"I recently received this item through my Verizon store. Everything is great EXCEPT the front camera uses a WIDE ANGLE LENS, which means that all pictures are DISTORTED. All selfies look terrible and distorted from what you actually look like. There is a ""Shape Correction"" software feature within the camera that literally displays text saying ""Correct Distortions in your Face"" but it DOES NOT CHANGE THE DISTORTION at all and does not help fix the problem. I have attached pictures I took with the S7 and have not altered them at all. Look at how ridiculous they are."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 17, 2016",1.0,S7 Camera is not good compared to Samsung S6,"S7 Camera is not good compared to Samsung S6. I still love my Samsung S6 videos and pictures. That's reason I thought of upgrading it, but it was a bad choice. Clarity is much less and the overall picture quality is poor."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 6, 2016",5.0,"Awesome. Made me buy a smartphone. I use it for the GPS, photos and videos.","I got one of these at T-Mobile and this phone is crazy awesome. It has replaced my GPS and camera for most of our hiking.My only criticism is the lack of Adoptable Storage. I really want this feature. Or think I do. 32GB is not enough memory and most of my apps do not transfer to the SD card. I've heard both that Adoptable Storage fixes this and that it doesn't. I couldn't tell you which is correct since I don't have it.But, note this is still a five star review. Why's that? Awesome screen, good battery life, pretty good GPS, fast processor, perfectly sized phone - although hard to grip without a case, which is why I recommend a RhinoShield Crash Guard.I pretty much only care about maps, news and emails, but the voice quality on this phone is outstanding when you get to connect to another HD Voice device.I use AllTrails and PDF Maps (with Tom Harrison maps) for hiking. Both work awesome on this phone. The phone's GPS is definitely not as good as my dedicated Garmin eTrex 30 GPS, but it is probably better than my original black and white eTrex Vista and definitely better than my Nuvi 3490. The battery drains fast while I'm recording a track with the phone, but it has had more than enough juice for 12 mile hikes. You must record tracks if you want the GPS to be useful while hiking as getting a fix at the application takes too long if you aren't recording the track. Heavily forested areas cause grief for the phone's GPS whereas my eTrex 30 has no problem at all. The eTrex 30 will also last more than 24 hours while recording everything. However, the phone utterly blows away the eTrex 30 for map quality - and yes, I bought TOPO maps for the eTrex 30. I mean, if I know I'm not going to be in a heavily forested area, and that I'm not going to be out all day, then I always prefer this phone over the eTrex 30. The maps are that much better and the phone's display obviously trounces the eTrex 30's display. And the phone is waterproof just like the eTrex 30!My Canon PowerShot S120 is very obviously the better camera... for still shots. You can see the difference right away if you have an eye for this stuff. I think the phone's main problem is image processing more than the actual sensor. The other thing is there is no optical zoom on the phone obviously. However, the phone does have optical image stabilization and it is pretty good. In a twist, the phone is light years ahead of the S120 for video. I shoot in UHD 30fps (not the default) and the video is amazing. The file size, though, does get to be enormous. Better have a high capacity SD card in there if you do a lot of video with UHD. All this said, the still shots with the phone are very good and are probably better than a lot of lower priced point and shoot cameras. So, when I'm not on vacation or doing something that I really want to get the best shots with, I prefer the phone since it is small and easy to carry. Well, I always have the thing on me, don't I?I had resisted getting a smartphone, because the data costs weren't worth it to me. I do not care about social media, texting, or any of that garbage. I do care a lot about maps, photos and videos since I like to do things in real life. This is the first smartphone that really fit the bill for all of this. It's like it was made just for me. It just needs Adoptable Storage. Please, Samsung/T-Mobile, enable that in an update."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 9, 2016",5.0,Best Galaxy yet.,"To start, I am definitely not an expert in electronics or computers, but being a millennial I can say a few things I like about this phone. I traded in my S6 edge on Verizon's network and got the regular old, flat screen S7. Why? Because my edge had a green line running along the right edge of the phone. It was also hard to type while laying down because my palm reached over and hit keys I didn't want to. I've heard they fixed that on the new edge and note 7. However, I was sick of it and decided I didn't want it on my new phone. I love the fact that it now accepts a memory card. I bought the Samsung brand 128 gb card to hold all of my music, I haven't filled it, but seeing as how all my songs wouldn't fit on my s4 or s6, this is definitely an improvement. The water proof feature is nice. I work for public works in the Pacific Northwest. It is wet up here, and I don't have to worry about my phone. So far I have no complaints at all. It is definitely better than the s6. You can tell they took their time designing this one, and they did a good job. PLUS!!!! The rounded back makes it really comfortable to hold."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 3, 2017",4.0,Great phone. A few things to consider if accustomed to US phones,"We bought this for use with a prepaid plan in the US.  It works more or less as good as you would expect. The camera is great as are most features.If you are buying this for use in the US please note that this is an international version of the phone. As far as I can tell there are only a few areas in which this matters. First it came with a USB to micro USB cable with an enormous travel adapter that clearly wasn't meant for US outlets. It will fit in US outlets, but rather loose. If you stick in a wall outlet it just falls out. It does work better if you stick it in a surge protector lying flat on the floor, since that way it won't fall out.  The second difference between all US version of phones I have experience with is that there is no dedicated slot for the micro SD card. Instead, you have to stick the micro SD card in one of the SIM card slots. It works, but feels less convenient than having the SD card slot on the side of the device."

I was surprise to see  the Service Repair Statement, thy changed 4 parts1- Audio-Receiver part2- Incell Battery Pack3- Assy VT Camera-5m4- Assy Speaker Moule_SMWhat happen I sent my NEW PHONE to fix the mic and got 4 parts changed.When I looked at my phone frame it was damaged from the corner where technician insert the screw driver to take the digitize out. I got mad and called Samsung support to complain. In the beginning Samsung Support tried to tell me that my phone was damaged before!!!!! my phone was NEW and with its original plastic cover when I send it to them and was very clean.Anyway at the end they told me to send the phone back to them to replace the frame, i mailed the phone and it came back to me after 11 days. Guess what, nothing was changed and the Service Repair Statement say they did test on my phone and updated the software!!!!I sent email to Samsung managers on 'Officeofpresident@sea.samsung.com'; 'president@sta.samsung.com' explaining what happen and seeking help. I was contacted by on of their managers and after listening to my problem she told me Samsung will send you a new phone to replace your phone. I was happy but not for long, after few minutes I received email from support to cancel the replacement offer. I sent couple of emails after that and I was ignored.I believe Samsung did not hear about “Customer Satisfaction”DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG if you want good Support and fair treatment"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"June 20, 2016",4.0,Messed up a good thing.,"The phone functions well after 2 weeks of owning it. I dinged it a star for two reasons. 1. There is not a built-in setting to change how long the home keys stay lit. I had to download an app to change that. 2. The edges of the screen are curved. This is a huge design flaw. I prefer the glass screen protectors over the plastic film. The curve of the edges prevents me from having a screen that goes from edge to edge. It can only go on the flat part of the screen. That doesn't work for me, so I now have an unprotected screen. I like to keep good cases (Speck) and hardened glass screen protectors on my phones so that when I hand them down to my kids after a year or two, they are still operable and in great condition. Samsung already has the Edge, so why not just leave the screen on the flat phone actually flat. Bad decision, Samsung. I may have to go back to LG."

I briefly put it 3 inches underwater for 30 seconds and somehow water seeped into the phone and now it's bricked. Samsung makes wonderful claims about being waterproof, but they refused to replace or repair any water damage. Look at their warranty, they will not cover water damage of any kind.

I have been waiting 5 days for a call back about it, and finally today after two other reps told me they would process a refund for me I am told that the only option I have for a replacement phone is to send it in to their service center and wait for a repair or replacement. This process will take about 3 weeks. Given all the problems they have had with their galaxy note 7 I really thought they would offer me something to help keep me as a customer, but nothing. I have owned all 7 versions of the galaxy series phones, a gear vr, 3 Samsung tablets, a gear 2 smartwatch, and 1 note series phone. Apparently this information does not matter to Samsung."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 9, 2017",1.0,S7 poor performance.,"I purchased the S7 G930F about 8 months ago and was really happy with its features and performance. After about 3 or 4 months it started running very warm. It also began to freeze which would some times require rebooting the phone. Within a month or so it was happening a few times daily. I have performed all of the various resets recommended by Samsung, but the freezing continued and the phone progressively got hotter - none of the buttons would work until it completely cooled down.  Finally a week ago it made a loud buzzing sound and got really hot and died. Samsung would not warrant the phone because it is an international version.  So much for their $700 phone of the year. I wonder how many other S7 phones are having the same overheating problems the Note 7 has become known for."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 3, 2016",3.0,Very disappointed by this misrepresentation,This phone said it was unlocked and never mentions a word about a specific carrier you have to use.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"January 9, 2017",3.0,The Glass Slipper of Phone Technology....Literally......,"Bought this phone because of it's excellent photo capability.  Over all a very nice phone. I've had it for about a week when I discovered the entire phone is GLASS.  Please be aware that a very short drop onto a rigid hard uneven surface WILL crack the glass back most likely making that 'water resistance' useless.  When I purchased the phone I assumed the case was aluminum as I went with the spun gold version until my son set it down on some rocks during a photo shoot.  We saw him put it down and the 'drop' was less than an inch.  Later he picked the phone up to leave and sure enough, a horizontal crack had appeared.  The glass case made it easier to seal for water resistant however, given the choice...I'd rather have a phone that was good o' fashion rubber, plastic or aluminum then....GLASS and water resistant.  Seriously who makes a cell phone out of glass?! It's got great capabilities but if you have to treat it like a glass slipper, what's the point?"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 30, 2016",1.0,Battery life kills this phone - Stay away,"I've been using this phone for a few months (mind you I also needed a replacement because my first S7 had re-boot issues). Yes, overall it's good phone (when you have one that works). The problem with it is the battery. I have been having to constantly plug it in through out the day, and I barely use the phone enough to demand this. I stay on top of closing my apps after using them, and try to keep brightness down. When I look at my battery statistics, the two biggest drainers are usually Android System and Android OS.If you're looking for a slim pretty phone with no ability to even swap out the weak battery, this is your best bet. Also, what's the point of putting a beautiful screen on a phone if you have to keep it at 10% screen brightness the whole time? I'll be switching to a Droid Turbo because I actually want to use my phone."

I called Samsung and they refused to give me back the money I paid for the phone and will do nothing other then to look at it! I would not advise anyone to buy this product and I'd be curious about the Samsung Galaxy 8 as well.

I work in the USA and travel internationally in the mobile technology space with speaking engagements, and will be re-telling this story to any user, including corporations and colleges, as well as people in the mobile technology or mobile learning space. From the executive customer support staff I was told that it is because of the differing currents in different countries. Total nonsense!

I was given a stiff screw off on my first attempt with the S5 and I didn't even try for the second.Yeah I have insurance, but its still $175 and I get a refurb back, not a new phone.

I actually like this.- They brought back the SD card slot (one reason I didn't get the S6)- To the fellow that complained about dropping it from over a foot and it breaking..... buy a case... its what people do with a $700 phone.Cons:- Battery life is still good, but not as good as my S5... I will play with it all day and it will still have about 40% left as opposed to 60% with my older one.- Headphone jack on the bottom of phone... personal preference I suppose, but I liked it on the top.- Still has the more complicated menu settings of android phones... Ex: Might take you a few minutes to find the right tab to rename your phone.- Samsungs ""SmartSwitch"" isn't great when transferring files to your new phone.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 28, 2016",5.0,Great Phone That Goes Beyond My Initial High Expectation,"This phone was much better than I expected. The phone battery is long lasting, the screen is beautiful with amazing colors, the camera is impressive (especially in low light), super loud speakers, and the OS has so many features.  The phone feels great in my hand and feels like a quality phone.My only complaints about the phone is the placement of the speaker (easily covered by my hand when holding the phone in landscape) and the App Drawer not automatically rearranging the apps when uninstalling/removing an old app (TouchWiz issue). This is minor issues compared to my enjoyment of the phone."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 16, 2016",4.0,"Great for traveling, and offers great performance all around.",Great performance offered by Samsung's Exynos octa core chip. Top of the line specifications in international version. Not localized but for global market. You will not get volte nor video chat which are features offered by carriers.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 6, 2017",2.0,No more Samsung,"Worst galaxy after the S6. Screen freezes from time to time, it's very slow, takes several minutes to open the camera app for example, can't really switch between apps because of lack of performance, battery don't last even half a day when one use the phone, without using it last maybe one day (12 not 24 hours). The only positive things are a memory card slot, waterproof and nice design. After several years of buying Samsung phones I will definitely switch to another brand!"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"October 11, 2016",3.0,I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge because I thought it would be the best of the few that I was offered,"Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge is without question the most gorgeous cell phone out.  But that is as far as it goes in my opinion.  After all, smartphones are mostly about functionality.  Face it, these are handheld computers.  Many if not most of us have come to depend on our smartphone to live our personal lives by.  My brother has always had the most current Galaxy phone and im not sure if he's ever tried anything else.  I am a retired AT&T service rep and for 29 yrs, phones were my business.  I have used Motorola and HTC but mostly LG.  I had a problem with my latest LG G4 overheating and not holding charge.  It was replaced 4 times and eventually AT&T agreed to replace it with a different model.  I was left with a few choices, since it was a warranty replacement, none of them being an LG phone. I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge because I thought it would be the best of the few that I was offered.  I HATE IT!!  I have felt for a while that Samsung, being super rich and powerful in the cell phone arena, has stacked the reviews against LG.  There is literally no comparison in these phones.  LG G series and V series phones are far above Samsung in a number of ways.  LG phones work much more proficiently.  Their menus are much more organized and have many more options to customize and personalize your phone.  I do not believe I will adjust to the Galaxy S7 and learn to like it because it is sluggish with lots of stuff in it but functioning often with no rhyme nor reason.  One important app that I used on LG phones to make custom personalized ringtones and notification tones will not work on the S7 Edge.  The music player is cumbersome and got too much junk that I don't like or want.  I will have to deal with this phone for at least 6 months of the remaining contract  before I can get another LG phone.  I have no beef or personal vendetta against Samsung but this is just my most honest and sincere experience with these phones."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 21, 2017",5.0,Great Product,"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is the best phone I have ever had. After buying a Samsung, I will never go away. They definitely just gained a loyal customer. The camera is remarkable. The auto focus is spot on every time. I can be moving my phone and the camera will still pick up the objects. The clarity of the camera is something short of astounding. It is so good, I can zoom in and see pores on an individual’s face. The zoom capabilities are also phenomenal. Even at full zoom, the camera still is clear. The battery is also a highlight of this phone. I can be on it all day and still end up with 13% battery at 10:00 p.m. Another cool feature is the power saving mode. There is a mode where it will allow you to go days on just a single charge. I have had no issues with speed. The processing has been smooth and hasn’t had any glitches or bogs. As long as the internet connection is good, there is no buffering online. Games are fast, videos don’t buffer, and calls don’t drop. Having a waterproof phone is also a plus. Now, I can play music off my phone while in the shower and still be able to change the song! It also allows for mess ups. How often have you heard of people being pushed in a pool or had their phone fall in a toilet? That isn’t an issue anymore because the phone is rated to be under water for 30 minutes. There are a couple things that I don’t like. I don’t like the low quality pictures that are taken on snap chat. This is Snapchat’s fault, not Samsung’s. I also don’t like the group message. I can only send texts to 10 people at a time. This is inconvenient. Other than that, this phone is superior to all other phones of its generation. When looking at phones, I give this 5 stars. This is a phenomenal product. I would highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a phone. Best of luck on your search!"

The phone comes with a 32gigs of memory and it also has a  slot for a micro memory card, you can decide how much more memory you need for this phone up to 299gb.  The phone comes in a sleek onxy finish.  It is thin and smooth.  The camera is awesome on this phone with a 12 megapixal on the rear, 5 megapixal on the front.  It also has a feature to shoot in low light and the pictures come out aswsome.  The s7 is also water resistant for 30 mins and up to 5 feet of water.  You can also  make your phone unique by using the features to change the background etc.  Other brands you would have to jailbreak the phone to custom it.  The battery is fast charging so if your in a hurry your phone is to and always ready when you are.I do not work for or am I affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"December 8, 2016",1.0,Stay away; phone may not make calls,"Worst phone I've ever owned. I'm on my third S7. I've spent hours in the phone store getting help from ""experts"". I've tried calling Samsung. I've replaced the ""defective"" devices with a new ones. I've given up. My S4 worked like a dream, BTW. I never had a complaint. The second I replaced it with the S7, my life became hard. It drops calls all over town and at my home, on or off WiFi calling. People can't hear me. I can't hear people. There is sometimes static. I can't even call for pizza or make a doctor's appointment without either having to call twice (due to call droppage) or having to hear the other person repeatedly say, ""What did you say? You're cutting out..."" I can't replace the stupid thing with another brand because after having nonstop trouble, the window to return it ran out. I now must wait to pay it off in 2 years and suffer through this cruddy nonsense. Or pay even more to activate a home line so I can make phone calls. The S7 (at least based on the 3 I've had in the past couple of months) is utterly worthless for anything other than surfing the Web, using apps or watching videos. I will probably never buy from Samsung again after this expensive experience, and until now, I've been a loyal Samsung fan! This phone completely disappoints. If you can't make a clear 5-minute phone call from a nearly perfect call-reception area, you really shouldn't call the device a ""phone."" It is nothing more than a small tablet. Save your money."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"September 27, 2017",3.0,Great phone with reception issues,"I used it over a year and it is a great phone with few issues. I believe people use cellular phones mostly for data and very little for voice calls! I will not bother why it is a great phone since you have plenty of reviews covering it. But here is why I gave it 3 stars. My wife uses an iPhone and I use S7. We both have T-mobile as the carrier. At home, I can only use my phone for voice calls in one tiny spot with poor sound quality and most of the time other parties will not hear me. My wife's iPhone works perfectly everywhere at home... In my opinion, it is the quality of the antenna (actually the lack of it) causing this reception issue. We are using the same carrier, the same cell tower, and staying at the same location and I cannot have decent voice call. A phone with that price is supposed to provide you with acceptable call quality comparable to iPhone. S7 will not give you that."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 22, 2016",5.0,Impressed by the new galaxy s7 😀,Even though is advertised as being water resistant and not waterproof it seems like it could be; because of ip rating and well I went swimming and used it under water for almost 2 hours I had no troubles with it damaging any of internal ports or components of the phone. I suggest if you going to buy the phone make sure to go to settings and go to the application manager and go to the battery and click on details there will be a option to save battery on every application you use if you don't you're going suffer alot of drainage in battery because sometimes apps stay in the background taking up all the ram and draining the battery life. One last thing for the us models it has a Sony camera sensor and a Qualcomm snapdragon processor and for other countries outside of the us it uses a Samsung exynos processor and a Samsung oiscell camera sensor. You also might want to buy a really good case because the phone is made of a glass back and aluminum alloy side and bottoms.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 25, 2016",5.0,Excellent smartphone with 4GB of ram,"The Samsung Galaxy S7,Where do I start. Excellent smartphone with 4GB of ram, sleek and slim metal body, 12-mp camera (excellent in low light), 32GB storage and a Quad HD display. This stunning device is worth the price. The Samsung Galaxy S7 is not just another regular smartphone, it is a powerful gaming machine. With the new Mali-T880 MP12 GPU, console-type games can run without any lag on the device without draining the battery. I forgot to mention the 3000mAh battery which is a big step up from the S6's battery. The Galaxy S7 is much more power efficient than the S6 and the battery can last a long time with the Ultra Power Saving Mode. It is also full ip68 waterproof meaning that it can be underwater 1.5m depth for 30-minutes and come out perfect. Unlike the Galaxy S6, the S7 has expandable storage. You can insert a micro-sd card up with a maximum of 200gb of capacity. That will solve the problem that everyone has, the problem of low storage available.  The Galaxy s& is recommended to all those people out there who want a quality smartphone with a powerful processor, a stunning QHD display, and overall the very best smartphone."

I absolutely love the fact that it's waterproof I have been experimenting with taking pictures underwater with it and the 12 megapixel camera definitely can take some high quality photos even if underwater. This phone is extremely sleek and has great build quality it just feel great in my hands.

The camera is currently the best available on a smartphone. Fingerprints recognition add security. Size is perfect.To Samsung:I just would like Samsung to work on two sides:1. Camera. Make it DSLR like. It is still far away from a good camera.2. AI (Artificial Intelligence). This is hot and where the future is. S-Voice is still very primitive ""CALL ... JOHN ... SMITH"" ... ""WHAT ... WEATHER ... IS ... TOMORROW"". Annoying. Think about the following conversation with a Samsung smartphone: ""Samsung writes the following message via WhatsApp to John please ... John see you tonight at home at seven pm"" ... ""The message has been sent to John. Can I do something else for you?"" ... ""Oh yes .. can you please read me the last message from Susan please?"" ...  and so forth. Natural talking.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 4, 2016",5.0,GS7E--GR8 addition to Samsung lineup!,"Received my AT&T Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge as a preorder and I LOVE IT! It is beautiful, it is ""edgey,"" and it is FAST!. Although I love the curves and the way it feels in my hand, it did attract fingerprints, so I placed a Skinomi screen cover (great cover, BTW, and easy to install) AND a cover (currently using Samsung clear black S view case) to limit fingerprints and prevent damage to this gorgeous phone. Can't believe how long it lasts on 1 battery charge. I am currently using Samsung stand fast charger, and I've got to say, it is really speedy! At night, I place it on my Tylt Vu, and it charges while I sleep, then shuts off so no overcharge. The phone is lightning fast and handles everything I've thrown at it. I LOVE the availability of THEMES, many of which are free, and the remainder are really inexpensive--nice way to personalize the phone! This was an upgrade from a Galaxy S5--I skipped the S6--love the S7E return to additional storage via micro SD card (up to 200 GB!) and water-resistance. Thought I'd miss the replaceable battery the S% had, but this battery is a BEAST and haven't missed replaceable at all. The Edge is a nice feature--still learning how to best utilize it. Phone calls are clear, SMS messages are rapid. Overall, this is a super phone!"
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 9, 2016",5.0,"Just got it, and I love it","I preordered this phone through Verizon wireless website and it came ahead of schedule on March 8. By ordering through a carrier the price was a few hundred dollars cheaper than what the unlocked version costs on amazon. Out of the box you get the phone itself, a charging cable, headphone earbuds, a usb connector (to connect 2 phones together), and a tool to open the sd card tray. Its easy to not see the small metal sd card tray tool, so be careful. I am switching from a Samsung S4 and the quality of this phones build is noticable. The S4 was made of plastic and felt cheap, the S7 is glass front, glass back and metal sides and feels sleeker and sturdier. I was concerned that the back was made of glass but the guy at the verizon store says they get very few complaints of the back shattering. I rarely drop my phone so I'm not worried. You can insert a removable SD card into a tray at the top of the device. you stick the SD card tool into a little hole at the top and a tray pops out. If you pull the entire tray out the SIM card can fall out so be careful. This phone is physically bigger than my S4 (length) but slightly thinner.Setup was a breeze although it took some time. I had to log into verizonwireless website find the right links and activate the phone from the website. If you by from a physical location they will set it up for you. Most of my apps, pics, and settings transferred over automatically.There is a fingerprint scanner in the home screen button, but you can choose other security options like pattern or pin if you so choose. Speakers are on the bottom near the usb input and headphone jack, so that means if phone is lying face up you can still hear from the speakers (S4 speakers were on back which meant sound could get muffled when laying the phone down or if hand is covering back). not a fan of headphone jack on bottom but thats a minor annoyance. Screen is bright and looks great. Camera is fewer MP than the S6 but this camera supposedly lets in more light. All the pictures I took look great.The phone moves very fast. There is no lag opening apps. For all of you who are dropping your phones in the toilet or in your beer, this phone is waterproof! SAMSUNG PAY! So this was a surprise to me, Samsung Pay is awesome. The Galaxy S7 supports MST which simulates the magnetic stripe on your credit card which means you can use Samsung Pay anywhere that has a credit card machine. This is better than Android pay and Apple Pay which use NFC and can only be used at a small number of retailers.So first annoying thing I noticed was Verizon and Samsung put a bunch of their own apps on the phone. I was confused on how I should be sending text messages because there was a Google, Verizon and samsung messaging app! I just want one app to text, I dont need 3. Also the phone gets noticeably warm with use. i'm guessing this may partially be due to the fact that it has been downloading pics, contacts, apps and everything from the cloud. This is a bit surprising to me since this phone is supposed to have liquid cooling. If I were playing a game on the phone it would probably get pretty hot.So Pro/Con time:Pros:WaterproofRemovable Storage (phones without this just try to charge you more for storage, its cheap to buy SD cards)Camera (lower MP, but it lets in more light, pics look noticeably better)Bigger battery (longer battery life and fast charging, also able to charge wireless)Faster (no lag opening apps, browsing web is fast)Android MarshmallowCons:Bloatware (came pre loaded with 7 samsung apps, 8 verizon apps, not to mention 10 google apps but i actually use the google ones)Glass back attracts fingerprintsNo USB type C - small annoyance. Things are moving to type C and its nice that C fits both ways, but at same time micro USB is ubiquitous so I can use 1000 different micro USB chargers I have lying aroundCrashes - So far the phone has crashed at least once per day. and the fingerprint sensor has stopped working a few timesSHOULD YOU BUY?If you have S4 or older - This is a no brainer upgrade right awayIf you have an S5 - I would upgrade. They brought back the waterproof, you have the removable SD card slot, bigger processor bigger batteryIf you have the S6 - I probably wouldn't upgrade. Yes they brought back features that weren't on the S6 but I'm not sure that's worth spending the money to upgrade from the S6 after only a year. S6 is still a good phone.Wait for LG G5? - This is an interesting debate. The G5 has more unique features like modular accessories to add to bottom of the phone. LG ditched the leather customizable back for an all aluminum body so its now closer to Iphone in styling. The G5 does not have wireless charging or samsung pay (just android pay). Its really a toss up on which of these two you should get"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 8, 2016",1.0,Beware of faulty phone coupled with Samsung's bad customer service,"There is a possibility of getting a faulty phone, no matter what brand you use. But even if you bring your faulty S7 to the customer service of its originating country, Samsung WILL NOT do an exchange. Even though I bought it just a week ago. They'll simply do a factory reset, essentially wiping out the time you spent personalizing this phone. I had been using Samsung for years but I am definitely switching to Apple in the future. S7 burned such a big hole in my pocket that I just have to bear with a slow, constantly self-restarting, messed up mobile for now. Customer service is very important these days, so I am never buying anything from Samsung again."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 20, 2016",5.0,Great!  Love the camera especially.,"Echoing lots of other reviews, the phone is fast and responsive, the battery life is great, the screen is gorgeous, and overall functionality is great with the latest version of Android.I would say this phone is the maximum screen size for one-handed use.  With small hands, I was pressing the touch sensitive buttons to the left and right of the home button all the time.  I purchased a cheap case to provide a lip for my hand to rest which solves that problem.One thing that I LOVE is the camera.

The text function DOES NOT WORK. Its like you're drunk texting even when you're sober. And the internet search function sometimes works, if it feels like it, though probably not because this is an idiot phone for idiots.

I have used a Moto G (3rd gen) and that phone's software is far superior to that on the S7. Using this phone is death by a thousand cuts --- everywhere there could be elegance, there is clumsiness. Why doesn't ""do not disturb"" mode have a user-defined time limit? (I'm at a concert, I want DND for 2 hours, not indefinitely.) Why is it that **every time** I select a contact and then a phone number from the favorites screen, I also have to choose whether this is to be the default or just once? For apps this makes sense, for phone numbers this is just thoughtless user interface design. Why is there no easy way to tell the phone to use the SD Card for apps? I have to go the application manager, and then for each app, click on the app, click on storage, and only then can I see whether or not the app can be stored on the SD Card. Arrrggh."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 9, 2016",5.0,So far so good!,"So far pretty good! I got this yesterday 3 days early from Sprint and have been using it heavily since. I'm very happy with the functionality, it's fast, UI is great and Android Marshmallow is absolutely amazing.Overall I am very impressed so far and I like it far better than my friend's Galaxy S6 or my dad's S5. I was worried about switching away from HTC because I loved my HTC's metal frame but this is much sturdier than I was expecting and feels very solid in your hand. The UI's have their differences (TouchWiz vs HTC Sense) but overall quite similar and not too difficult to transition.The ""Always On"" display is a very simple but amazing feature and bringing back water resistance and expandable memory is what made me switch to the GS7. Fingerprint reader is better than any other phone one I've used and extremely quick. Photos (front and rear camera) come out clean and the shutter is very quick. Have yet to test it in low light but I will be updating this review with more information when I get to testing more features. Being able to split screen apps is quite wonderful and I'm using it more than I would have expected myself to. I got home last night after using it down to about 40% battery life and plugging into the normal MicroUSB charger it went from 40%-70% in about 30 minutes so it does charge very quickly. I have yet to get a wireless QI charger yet but plan to soon.My only gripe so far is battery life. I typically use my phone somewhat heavily and I took it off the charger this morning at 8am. It is now 2pm and I'm at 56%. It's not quite as good as I was expecting but I'm sure as I manage it more and get my task killer apps installed but when I'm getting barely more than the 2 year old HTC One M8 I traded in for this I guess I was somewhat shocked.All in all I'm very happy so far. I'll update this review as I keep using it more and more and I'm sure battery life will increase as I manage the apps and stop playing with it as often as I have been (pretty much non stop for the last 16 hours)."

But I am giving only 2 stars.  No matter what, this phone always uses data unless your data is already turned off before you turn on your phone. (not waking from sleep mode, you literally reboot the phone) So, if your phone is turned on and is on 4G meaning using Data and you find Wi Fi at the Airport or a Coffee shop or at Home you connect to that Wi-Fi then it still uses data. So, after connecting to Wi Fi I turned off data, I still see the 4G symbol and it still uses Data. I tested this several times and this is the result. Then the only way to use Wi Fi is to turn the phone off complete and turn it back on (reboot)."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 5, 2016",5.0,Samsung is back at its PRIME...,"I got one of these bad boys earlier. So here's my input on it.The Samsung Galaxy S7 is an amazing piece of technology. Samsung stuck with the glossy, glassy design, while bringing back the stuff we loved. Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SD card EXPANSION/ This was a huge difference from Apples and Galaxies. So why on Earth did they ditch storage expansion, I don’t know. But it’s back! Not only that, but it fits well with the SIM card. Another thing they brought back to the S7, waterproof! Admittedly, the S6 was really good against water, but it’s nice to know the S7 can official survive and a few meters of water. The phone is faster than ever, and Android Marshmallow is so clean. They improved TouchWiz UI; now it’s not that ugly lime and blue color. The phone in the hand is comfortable, unlike the sharp edges of the S6 and S6 edge. Camera is very responsive and takes the best low light photos I’ve ever seen. The 12 Megapixel camera, seems low in terms as pixels, but uses an amazing technology called Dual Pixel Autofocus. Overall:Pros:-Better Battery Life (3000 mAh)-Faster (Exynos 8890)-Great Camera (12 MP)-Storage Expansion-WaterproofCons:-Slippery in handsIn conclusion, if you like the S6’s design and wished it had more “Android” features, this is the perfect phone. Samsung improved on everything and Galaxy lovers can’t be happier. Samsung listened to it’s audience and did everything right! If you’re coming from an Apple device, no time would be better to switch!"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"August 10, 2016",1.0,NOT WATERPROOF,I dropped mine in 4ft of water and the touch screen stopped working. Samsung doesn't honor sumbermersion in their warranty but luckily I got a new one sent to me through the geek squad at best buy. I recommend a lifeproof case if you intend on using in water conditions.
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 22, 2016",5.0,Great phone BUT,"I love this phone. It's great! Does exactly as intended, just as any phone would. My only problem is the the edges are not slightly raised to protect the screen from SOME scratches like my previous S5 was. Was at work today and whilst walking back to the break room I pulled it from my back pocket and dropped it. Slid screen down (waiting for my case to get to my house from Amazon) for a couple feet and didn't notice any scratches until I was outside and the sun reflected, showing me 5 long but very slight scratches on the screen. Not happy but it's just my fault as well as the manufacturer for bending to peoples wants for a better feeling in their hands. Otherwise it's wonderful!  EDIT: There is a UI problem with this phone that isn't fixed yet, but there is a simple solution to it. If you find that your power button does not work as well as your volume down button... Just hold the power and volume down button until it turns off and restarts, then it'll be fine. Happened twice the last couple days. Annoying, I know, but it should be fixed in a little while. Other than that I still love it. Battery is great but took forever to charge the first couple days, that'll change after a little while people!"

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 6, 2016",4.0,Honest Review. Awsome Phone With Few Issues.,"I preordered the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge from T-Mobile on the 23rd. I received it on the March 1st, ahead of the official launch. As soon as it came in, I put my old phone down (Samsung Note Edge) and started using my new gadget.Right out of the box, the first think I notices was how thin it was. The camera bump is almost non existent. It may also be worth mentioning I got the Titanium Silver, although it has a sort of gold tint to it. The body feels solid and very well built. The four buttons (Home, Power, volume up and down) are well fitting and there is little wiggling.What we don't see is the dust and water resistant properties, and frankly, I do not want to test it out.The speaker, voice hole, power/usb port. and headphone jack are all on the bottom of the phone. At the top is another microphone hole, and the sim card/storage card slot.This is preference, but I dislike having my earphone jacks on the bottom of the phone. Also, the major selling point of this phone, the edge's, are all but lost in the sleek design. Unlike the Note Edge, the edge just seems too narrow and thin, making it more of a visual appeal rather than an actual useful tool. The Note Edge had a sharper slop and large edge screen for actual apps, short cuts, ect. For the S7 Edge, you have to bring out the modified ""edge screen"", and honestly, even the S7 non-edge can do same thing. Overall, getting the S7 Edge over the S7 non-edge is just the size of the screen.The Home button has a finger scanner in it, so when you register a passcode, you can assign your finger print as well to unlock faster. So far it works very well.The camera quality is excellent. The best I have seen on a phone. This comparing to the Note Edge's 16MP and Moto Pure's 21MP. MP now are more for numbers and touting, but S7 Edge proves that a ""lower"" MP count of 12 can surpass the quality of higher MP cameras. The pictures in low light, action shots, close ups, bright lights, ect are fast and accurate. I have yet to encounter much blur. This is a huge leap from the past Samsung cameras that have been plagued with zooming and focusing issues.The OS. With the power behind this phone, and 4 GB of ram, this thing flies. I spent so time removing the bloatware that Samsung packs on it. The enhanced edge menu is not as good as the standard Note Edge's menu. Unfortunately, either the phone hardware or the Marshmallow Android operating system is having some issues.Apps on the phone work good about 80% of the time. The other 20% I have had issues with the app just closing all together. This is probably due to the ""newish"" Android OS that comes installed, so hopefully it gets patched soon.The screen is extra sensitive, even after calibration. I scroll, and am very careful not to move my finger too fast or double tap, but the phone 30-40% of the time registers it as a tap. Also, wifi cuts in and out. I have switched routers, reset phone, ect, but the wifi drops a few times an hour. Mostly when the phone screen turns off.The screen picture is beautiful. can't say much more than that. Can't wait to try with the Gear VR.Finally, call quality. For me, the speaker is not very loud, both on speaker phone mode and off. Sound on the other end of the call seems adequate, so no complaints there.In summary, the phone is pretty dang good. The now useless edge screen, wifi issues, screen sensitivity issues, and app issues are the reasons why the phone does not get a perfect score."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"May 9, 2016",1.0,No synchronization with Outlook -- who needs it?,"DO NOT buy this phone if you want to be able to synchronize your calendar and contacts from your computer.  After 2 hours being bounced around among AT&T, Samsung, and Microsoft (not to mention the hours I spent trying on my own to synchronize my Outlook data with the phone), the answer, apparently, is that it is a ""known issue"" that a Galaxy S7 cannot be synchronized with Outlook.  Seriously.What it will do, instead of synchronizing, is duplicate entries between the computer and the phone.  So, if you had a haircut set for Wednesday, synchronized that with Outlook today, then moved that appointment to Friday on your Outlook calendar on the computer, guess what?  Next time you synchronize, your Galaxy S7 and Outlook will show haircut appointments on Wednesday AND Friday.It gets worse.  If you didn't move the appointment, after synchronizing, you will show two identical entries for that haircut on Wednesday.So, basically, you can't use this phone for calendar and contacts.  Or, at least, that's the answer after 2 hours of having the technical support people remotely control the phone."

(So I thought)..This freakin phone started overheating all of a sudden while it was being charged by my bed. I quickly unplugged it to check the charger and it was melting! Then I felt something hot by my feet and bro! MY FREAKING BED WAS ON FIRE! This phone caught on fire while I was checking the charger!

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 11, 2016",1.0,Malfunction/flimsy,"Flimsy as hell.  Screen malfunctioned after the user had it for 14 days.  It was never dropped.  After the user tried navigating through the phone with the help of google and verizon, the back of the screen cracked a bit.  A phone should be way more durable then that.  Doesn't even have to be titanium allow mixture, just not a flimsy plastic that cracks easily to keep us from returning the phone.  DON'T BUY."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"April 8, 2016",2.0,... from Costco and had to return them due to bad battery life,"I purchased 2 of these from Costco and had to return them due to bad battery life.  I was lucky to get 6 hours out of them before I had to recharge.Having said that, I will say they were very good in the bright sunlight and the processor was faster than my S4 but I still opted to go back to my S4 due to the battery lasting all day.  I could just set the S7 on my desk and watch the battery power drain out of it without even using it.  I also tried the power saving mode with no noticeable difference.  The phones also generated a lot of heat which I assume was causing the battery drain.  Costco did give two extra large batteries for the phones as if they knew there was a power drain problem.  Costco/Verizon was very good at returning them.  I would probably upgrade to the S7 if the battery life can be solved.  For now I will stick with my old S4 which functions just fine."
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"July 4, 2016",1.0,Get an IPhone,"This phone is a joke. It doesn't work much of the time and I've wondered if I can live with this, I can maybe live without a phone at all. It can't keep internet connection for anything, especially wi-fi. The speaker works 5% of the time so I have to type my texts. The keys are so sensitive, stuff gets deleted if you even go near the phone and I have all the settings off that allow you to do stuff without touching it. The Google calendar doesn't save events when you create them so you miss appointments. There are a million other small things I can't believe are so stupid. Just get an I-Phone. I thought it would be better but it is by far worse than an IPhone. I dropped it in water for a split second and it's not working now. Great! So much for water resistant to dunks as their description says."

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F,"March 29, 2016",1.0,"Easily breakable, difficult to repair.","Avoid like the plague. The first time the phone landed on a hardwood floor from 2 ft. or so height the back of the phone cracked. Very not durable. Apparently not easily repairable either. Of course Samsung is not going to replace or repair it. I owned other phones before (iPhone, Moto X), they fell on the floor multiple times, none of them got damaged.The glass back is nonsense. It might look nice, but who cares how it looks if it will be either broken or covered by a protective case?Other thoughts: The power and volume down buttons stopped working right away. Apparently there is a workaround to make them work. Still not acceptable for a flagship phone. The Samsung Smart Switch software is a garbage - it didn't work at all (the other phone is Moto X 2nd gen with Lollipop, so well above advertised 4.0/4.3)."

However, my 1-star rating is based on the fact that the S7's Bluetooth cannot even find my car's Bluetooth signal. It worked fine with my Galaxy S4, but not with the S7."
