"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Feb-17,5,ABOUT FREAKING TIME!!!! UPDATED POST!!,"Over the years, I've tried maybe 6 Blu phones. All of them looked amazing, but we laggy to the point it drove me nuts and if take them back. I just got the Vivo XL2 and I'm absolutely happy with this phone. It's freaking stylish as usual, but it has tons of bells and whistles like a more expensive phone, and so far it works amazingly  well. I can't believe how nice this phone is for the price. Unreal. And ignore the 64 gig SD card limitation. It took my 128 gig no problem at all. LOVE MY NEW PHONE!!!  If Blu keeps this up, I'll keep buying Blu.I've had it for a week now and I still love it. It only got better. I failed to mention that this has quick charge, and comes with a case and arrives with a screen protector on the phone, with no bubbles or junk under the film. It also comes with an extra screen protector. I can't say how much I love this phone for the price paid. So happy with it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",7-Mar-17,5,Open Honest Review,"People love to get a new phone and,  while riding that new tech high, get on Amazon and shout ""BEST PHONE EVER""  when obviously it's not.  Here is my open honest list view of the Pros and Cons of this phone.Pros:Price: Even at the suggested retail of 149 usd, this phone out performs the price tagBuild quality: Built like a 700 usd flagship device. Manages to look both beautiful & professionalCall quality :  Perfect, which means it does what a phone is supposed to doScreen: at 720p its NOT as nice as an iPhone or Pixel, but it does look amazing on the 5.5 inch screenAntenna: Most forgotten feature of reviews... This phone has service in the basement of the hospital I work at, on both on Tmobile AND AT&T.  Having duel Sims,  I decided to put in both my personal and work sim cards in the phone. The Sony Xperia M5 Ultra I had before this got zero service for most parts of the basement.  This Vivo XL2 has at least 2 bars of 4g lte service through out the entire basement. Same sim cards, same Radio bands supported, and yet only this phone gets signal.Sound: loud and crisp, even with a back firing speaker.  I'd prefer a front facing speaker,  but oh well.Camera, both front and back:  Great cameras for 149 usd.... AVERAGE Camera for 700 usd.  So comparing the pictures to your iPhone or Galaxy s6 or Pixel pictures your gonna be disappointed most of the time. However, snap a pic in good lighting, share it to Facebook or Instagram, and you would be surprised how nice they look.Battery:  true 5 and 1/2 hours of screen-on time which is absolutely amazing.  However, though they claim its quick charging, it's really not.  2 hours to fully charge from 25% isn't standard quick charge, it's actually ""not slow"" charging at best.. LoLAnd finally IR blaster.  Not many phones have it anymore, but it's nice to be able to mess with the TVs at the hospital.  It's entertaining changing  the channel from Fox News to MSNBC, or vice versa, just to watch the brainwashed receptionists mind explode when someone actually disagrees with their world view.CONS:Skin/software:  Though its running Android 6.01 you'd be hard pressed to notice. The skin Blu decided to use makes it look and feel like a bunch of 16 year old kids tweaked it to something they thought looked ""cool"".  Easy fix,  use Nova or Google Now launcher and all is forgiven.Can't use duel sim and a MicroSD card at the same time.  Though the memory and ram upgrade (32gbs and 3gbs respectively) are more than enough for me, adding a 64 gb card will mean only using one sim card. As one slot is for a card or a sim.... It's not just this phone, but this is the one Im reviewing.No fingerprint scanner.  Can't use a lot of the new instant pay service without one.  Though at the 119 usd I paid for it, I can't complain to much.That's it with the cons. It's basically a phone on par with most flagship devices at a 1/4 of the price.I always buy unlocked carrier free versions of the phones I use as my daily driver.  The Vivo XL2 is without a doubt the best value I have ever gotten in a cell phone.  Is it the best phone ever??  Of course not.  Even Blu themselves sell better all around devices.  HOWEVER,  the XL2 may indeed be the best 149 dollar smart phone available as of March 2017."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",30-May-17,1,Update - don't waste your money!  A pretty solid four stars.  Could have been better.,"Update seven months in:  I've had to go from four stars to just one.  The phone worked well for about six months, though the shiny slippery back is very annoying.  But for the last month the phone has been almost unusable, and today it's become basically a brick. People who call me say they get busy signals. The phone itself freaks out. It will be normal, and then suddenly the app I'm using closes and the screen quickly flips through all the pages and then freezes on the add widget page. This happens when I'm just sitting there reading a Kindle book, typing a reply to a text, or browsing the web.  The phone will also suddenly refuse to accept input on the touch screen, or will shut down the keyboard when I'm typing.  I'll get a text, try to answer it, and the phone will shut down.  It's like it's gone insane or something.  I've tried everything, factory reset, all the updates, and even tried to get help from BLU.  All of my attempts to contact them were ignored.  Now I have to go out and try yet again to buy another phone!  I've had it with BLU and no longer recommend it.  I expect to get more than six months out of a phone!!!In the box :  phone, charger, wall adapter, headphones, screen protector, and silicone case.  Phone also had a screen protector already installed. This is my third BLU phone.  I'm disappointed that this one has a sealed battery, and if you do need two SIM cards, you can't use a  SD card.  There are only two slots, instead of three.  The fancy back that they make sound so awesome is anything but; it's not even really blue or shiny except in the brightest sunlight, and the surface is so slippery that the phone is hard to hold on to, and takes every opportunity to slide off the arm of the chair, the desktop, the nightstand, the dashboard, or anywhere else you might want to set it down.  It also has a few more quirks than my other BLUs  and was a little cranky over getting my favorite apps customized.  As much as the phone is an obvious attempt at an iphone clone, it doesn't seem to have as good an antenna as the iphone.  Meetings in an interior room in a large building mean I have no signal but I can hear coworkers phones getting texts.  That's not a huge deal for me as those meetings are only once a month and otherwise the signal is pretty reliable, and I didn't pay anywhere near $600 for the name brand.On the plus side, it does have plenty of onboard memory and readily connected with my net10 SIM card.  Apps work quickly, music sounds pretty good, and calls are clear.So overall a decent deal.  Just make sure you order a nice case when you order the phone, otherwise you'll be dropping the phone all the time, and the case that comes with it is an ugly whitish color that is just repulsive.A cautionary tale:  My first BLU phone was the  Life XL and I was very happy with it, all the utility of a $600 samsung or apple product at a fraction of the price.  Easy to set up and worked very well with my net10 account.  I""d still be using it if I hadn't dropped it on cement and made the display go all wonky.  The phone still worked just fine, but the screen was too blurry to live with.  So I ordered an identical Life XL.  Unfortunately that one came loaded with spyware. I filed a complaint with the seller, tojostore, but they refused to respond until I left bad feedback.  Then they quickly refunded my money without even asking for the phone back, so they know they were guilty.  Lesson learned, always buy just from Amazon, and immediately run a malware checker before putting any contacts or other personal information on the phone!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-Mar-17,1,Spyware still. Come on Blu get it together!,"Still has a security issue,waiting on Blu to respond 3 different malware detection apps,found stuff. Update: sent Blu screenshots of the all the stuff my spyware detection apps found stilllllll waiting for a response. (Update) 3-17-17 received email back from Blu they said their working on a update to fix the data breach, they better, this app Data ghost or data clone has super user permissions and can do whatever the heck it wants. I'm done with Blu forever This BS app even tryed to hide what it's doing"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",29-Jun-17,2,Absolutely amazing for this price range,"The first time it hit the ground the screen cracked.  I contacted BLU support who told me that there are no replacement screens available for this model.  The screen protector is the only thing holding it together.Included in the box is a 5v 2.0a charger, micoUSB cable, USB-OTG cable, earbuds with microphone, rubber phone case, screen protector, and one of those professional paper clips for opening the sim/SD card tray.  And, there was a screen protector already on the phone.The sim card / SD card tray is pretty flimsy, I wouldn't open it very often.  As other commentators noted, you can either have 2 sim cards or 1 sim card and 1 sd card.  You cannot have all three.The phone case does not fit correctly.  The lower right hand corner does not fully extend over the front edge of the phone, and it feels like the phone will slip out if I grab it by the case.  The case partially covers the microphone hole.There were a few Amazon apps pre-installed, but they had obviously been done so outside of the google play store as they would not update without asking the user to modify their app installation permissions.  Luckily, I was able to fully uninstall them.  After disabling what I didn't want and installing some basic google apps, it says I have used 11 GB of 32 GB.  Luckily this phone has not partitioned the main storage into multiple segments to simulate an sd card like the BLU studio energy.The display is stunning.  Good contrast between colors, very bright, and the curved edges are neat.Overall, I think this thing is perfect for $150.  But if you drop the screen, there is no replacement."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Mar-17,5,Worth every penny!,"I have to give this 5 stars! For the price this is a phenomenal deal. I waited 2 weeks to write a review and I must say this is a great phone! Looks good, works really well, storage is terrific. I did download the Evie go Launcher because I didn't like the stock launchers but that is all! I am never spending 700 on a phone anymore as long as BLU makes affordable awesome devices like this vivo xl2."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",29-Sep-17,5,Excellent!,"Got it today as described It's very nice, runs smoothly can play games smoothly takes excellent pictures (at least to me it does). The sound quality is perfect, video playback is good it's fast and the storage is not bad just perfect for me. For the people who said that they couldn't see the symmetry on the back of the phone as it was showed/described in the picture I'mma say this...LIES...if you hold it up at an angle literally don't have too, but you clearly can see it. The last and only #1 CON about this phone is yea, its true...that you are not able to use your sd/memory card if you're using 2 sims (the standard sim and or the micro/nano sim) MEANING you won't be able to use sd/memory card if you're using BOTH. For me only using 1 sim (3-in-1sim) i can say it's possible this phone does have dual sim so therefore in other words if you're using 2 sim cards you won't be able to your sd/memory card, BUT if you're using 1 not 2 but only 1 SIM (which is the standard size sim) then yes you ARE able to use your sd/memory card. This is through my knowledge and what I've experienced using BLU Vivo XL2."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",5-Apr-17,2,"Nice phone and Price, but was does the warranty give you?","Okay, I got the phone yesterday (4/4/2017) and was amazed by the stuff that comes with it for the price!  Ear buds, phone cover, screen protector,  USB 2.0 cord and charger.. It's a nice and sleek looking phone. Has Android 6.0  Marshmallow with it.  But I didn't get long enough time to play with it.  Why is that? The metal bracket on the SIM card tray fell off!  So I contacted Blu about it. Provided them the info they requested and included a picture showing what I was discussing. In case they were not sure.  I was told that cause this happened. It was void of warranty! And then told I need to pay to have it repaired!  Not even 24 hours old and I need to pay to get it fixed! WTF?!? Then they told me why not just contact Amazon to get a replacement! At least when contacting Amazon, they immediately fixed the issue and shipped out a new phone and took the old one back!  But still hard to believe this company refused to fix the issue. Would not believe that their product could have a manufacturer error on it! Something like this, the metal piece coming off the sim card tray should not void the warranty. After all, people need to use it to pull out the sim card to gain access to the memory card one is using also if they want to replace that with a new and better one!I like how the phone looks and the stuff it comes with. But I can not comment on how it is as a device.  Maybe when I get the other one I will update this review. So please be warned when buying! It's a shame this company did this!UPDATE! Had it for many months. It’s okay. But I am pissed off with the few updates they did. It was to add spam and spyware! And you can’t remove it!  Also still has the Security issues!  And was to.d back in April that they would have update to Nougat. And still being told it’s coming! It’s now 2018 and still no update! Just more spam and bloatware to slow it down!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",6-Mar-17,4,Great Phone with a nice OS. Earpiece speaker is not as loud as I'd like.,Everything works great only downside is the earpiece speaker is quieter than my previous Note 4. I work in an office setting so its quiet in here even then the earpiece speaker is hard to hear unless pressed firmly against your ear.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",26-Mar-17,1,Good looking quick phone but don't drop it,"The os and speed is ok but do not drop it! I bought this phone for my wife a week ago and my she  was carrying it in her hand and bumped the car door and it fell around 2-3 feet to the ground and the screen shattered it was really disappointing for a phone with ""gorilla glass 3""  the phone is nice looking and pretty quick but if you drop your phone a lot then this isn't the phone for you. it took one drop in my case to become a paper weight"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Sep-17,5,Good evening I have had the Blu VIVO XL2 for ...,"Good evening  I have had the Blu VIVO XL2 for almost three weeks now and  I must agree with  most of the people on here that this phone is great and for all those who are complaining. stop it  .  this is my third Blu phone in the last 7 years and each phone that I have brought from Amazon was better then the one before.  I have owned all the phones from Iphone  all the way down to the G-1. it takes a little time to get around and learn it but its fun doing it.  and you can buy  a  AMOR CASE WITH KICK STAND .  I will keep you inform .  but as of 9/20/2017 this phone is one of the best buys you can get for your money,Up dateIt's now the 27rh of September and my Vivo XL2 is working just Beautifully. Has been dropped and with the Amor case  didn't have to worry one second. Camera is great and a whole lot of fun. Total Charge in 2 hours. Fast operating  I read that the earbuds were no good. Man who ever said is deaf the ear buds sound just great great bass and really high highs. And the mid-range isn't a joke at all. Doesn't stall or slow down at all. And I charge my about every fourteen hours and for those who think  that's to Soo. Your nuts I'm on my phone all day long with no breaks. Bottom line you can't get a better phone then this for the price.  Thank you BLU for another great one"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Apr-17,4,I really like the phone,"I really like the phone.  My only real problem with it is that the triangle and square navigation buttons are reversed compared to other phones that I have had experience with.  While this is a small thing, it is a nuisance.  I know that this is my own fault because you can see this on the pictures of it but I didn't notice.  I had another BLU phone and it lasted until the warranty expired (95-100 days).  I have had this one for a couple of months now and so far, no problems."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",7-Jun-17,1,Phone dies then overheats - BEWARE,"UPDATE :I have owned this phone for just over 2 & 1/2 mos, and yesterday it went blooey!The phone was sitting on a desk when it began to cycle through a reboot process - this happened several times before the reboot completed to where the phone could be used.I checked it out, and it seemed fine. but about an hour later it went totally dead during use - - it would not turn on nor recognize any charger, no light came on to even acknowledge that a charger was attached.Later, when *trying* to get tech support I went to get my SIM card out of the phone and it was HOT to the touch - ACK!!!The BLU support site is a nightmare - you can not leave an email to ensure they got your support request, just a phone number... and it took multiple attempts to get their system to accept a support ticket.I have yet to hear from them, and I have the phone in a cooler in the garage in a ziplock bag with plastic ice packs :(Are they using the same batteries as the Note 7?!?Former review when phone was working :If you want a phone for calls, messaging, and a couple of app games at a reasonable price, this is it.I received it running Android 6.0 (it has not yet updated to 6.0.1, and I suspect it won't)If you're used to Samsung (or LG, or whatever) bloatware, the stripped down version running on this will look good - until you realize what it *doesn't* do.It means fewer options.Yes, you can ad apps for that, but since these impact processing, it'll slow the phone down.And this phone can't handle much in the way of processing.If you use your phone more often than a laptop or home computer to surf the 'net, this phone will frustrate you.Open more than 2 or 3 windows, or if you have any other apps running in the background, the Vivo XL 2 will often freeze up for a few moments or go black briefly - the Blu version of 'little spinning circle, I suspect.Doesn't crash, just - annoyingly slow.Sometimes it will take so long to load a page, the phone asks if you want to crash your browser...Don't bother, just pretend you're on dial-up... And it happens whether I'm out of the house with full bars or on WiFi with strong signal.Don't waste your money if the 'net access matters, go for it if you just need a dumbphone.For me, this is a (hopefully) temporary replacement for a Note 4 until the Note 8 comes out.If I had to use this phone for more than a few months I wouldn't keep it.When I'm done with it, though, it'll be handed off to a WAY less picky household member.YMMV..."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",12-Nov-17,1,Something has gone wrong,"Loving this so far...lots of space and working great for me....I have only had it for several days now. My last Blu phone is still working and I had it for 3 years so I am hoping I get better results from this one. I just wanted a newer model.2018-01-20Updated reviewI have had this phone lest than 2 months and I seems to have shut down on me. A wireless update was done last night and from then the phone started to malfunction.....it was working great up to that point. I am so annoyed right now.....who is going to refund me or give me a new phone?.....it costs too much money to send this back from Barbados. I cannot access anything in the phone, make any calls or receive any.....it would not even power off but all I am seeing is a black screen with an orange line surrounding it nothing else......so frustrated....I paid over $400BDS for this phone. My last Blu phone lasted over 3years and is still working but I gave it away.....what am I to do now."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",13-Nov-17,3,Not bad,"I've been using this phone now for almost 2 months. My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy s6. Overall, the phone is very nice. It has a nice, heavy feel. It takes decent pictures and I love the dual SIM option as well as the great storage and memory card slot. There were a few things that I found disappointing and it could just be that I'm comparing it to a much more expensive phone.For one, I don't like having ads on my home screen. I can live with it, but It's a pain.Two, the ringer volume is terrible. At It's max, I miss text messages all the time at work. Even when the phone is right in front of me. Yes my work is loud, but if my Samsung is in front of me, I hear a text.Three, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't personalize my home screen as nicely. I tried downloading several apps for themes and after they were added, I only got a background pic. I never got the theme icons. On that same note, I was disappointed that I can only change the size of the font, not the style.I was hoping to use the dual SIM feature to make this phone both my personal and work phone so I don't have to carry 2. But not only can I not hear the notifications well enough, I worry that the phone will not be powerful enough to handle dual phone tasks. I may upgrade to another phone and give this one to my 10 year old. She would be absolutely thrilled with it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Feb-17,5,Great Smartphone on a Budget,Super smart phone. Veery cheap on price but has great features. Has Android 6 preloaded which is an okay system. Great for the techie on a budget. Great screen and reception on MetroPCS
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-Aug-17,4,Love BLU,"Bought one for my wife in April.  Impressed, so I bought one for myself.  Done a lot of research and looked at a lot of phones.  Can't beat this one for the price.  Comes with 32GB memory.  More that enough for a lot of apps.  Phones with less memory have not worked for me.  Have not had a problem with either one (one gold, one blue).  Have to charge it daily which is standard for most smart phones.  Comes with case and screen protector.  Wifi works extremely well.  Blu uses a charger that is unique to Blu.  Can buy extras at Amazon.  Used camera sparingly, but is great for my purposes.  Not hard to learn to use.  Similar to a lot of other brands.  Used it as a bring your own phone (BYOB)to Tracfone.  Had no problems activating it.  Used chat instead of calling.  Nice big, bright screen (5.5"").  Have down streamed baseball, movies, etc.  One negative is that if it is used with Bluetooth (headphones), it will only work for calls, not down streaming movies, music, etc. To do that, have to use plug in headphones.  Overall a very good phone.  Sleek, thin and has a very nice touch.,  Have had several people ask me about it when using in public.  Most have not heard of Blu."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",9-Feb-17,5,So far it has been excellent! It feels,"I have had this phone for two weeks. So far it has been excellent! It feels, looks and operates like an expensive phone. For the price you can't beat it!!!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",15-Nov-17,2,Terrible customer support and fixing procces,"The screen went black just after the return period. So I had to deal with Blu support center, they insisted I perform a series of steps even when I told them the screen was completely black, after giving then serial #, purchased date, they insisted they want model number and a picture of the original box showing the bar codes and all that stuff. It took 2 days to get understand the information they wanted (because they insisted they need the model number) and I didn't know the model number it was the name of the phone. So finally they approved the verification and gave me address to ship phone (I had to pay shipping to their wherehouse) even though it was a defective device but they were kind to remaind me that if it was water damage or any other my fault I had to pay return shipping (just in case I wanted a broken phone back in my hands). Will never buy Blu again."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Aug-17,5,My wife has used the Energy 2 for over a year and it is still excellent. The phones seem to come with an increasing ...,"This is the 3rd BLU phone I've bought from Amazon.  I broke the screen on my Studio HD 5.0 Friday and had this at my doorstep Saturday afternoon.  I used the Studio HD for about 3 years and it was noticeably slowing.  My wife has used the Energy 2 for over a year and it is still excellent.  The phones seem to come with an increasing number of junk apps, but a quick launcher upgrade relegates them to the junk drawer where they belong.  Overall the quality and hardware exceeds what I would expect for the money, making BLU's phones a great value.  I also appreciate that the company is Florida based while they are manufactured in Asia just like every other phone."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Apr-17,5,Buy this phone.,"I had a Blu Vivo XL, which took a swim, so I got the new version.  I loved the first version, but I like this version even better.  GREAT PRICE.  Quality phone.  I am very, very pleased with it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-Sep-17,5,"Best phone I've owned, definitely worth the money","Let me start by saying that this is the best phone I've ever owned. I've owned about 8 phones, three of which were also BLU phones. I wouldn't say it's the best phone out there, but for the price... Wow.This phone does a lot for a phone that is only $150. It looks and feels great, it's pretty fast, and, best of all, comes packed with interesting features. It has a built in fake call app, for example, for when you need to slip out of awkward situations. Now that is something else.Back on a serious note, it's a nice size, in my opinion. Not tiny but not too big. I can hold and use it comfortably. Call quality is clear and I've yet to have any issues with connecting to WiFi or the cell network. The phone also comes with a case, a screen protector already on it (and no annoying bubbles!), And an extra screen protector, should you need it. It also comes with a charger, some sort of adapter (admittedly, I don't know what it is for, so refer to another review for that answer), and a pair of earbuds. For an audio guy such as myself, the earbuds sound quite disgusting, but for average users, they should be fine.The only issue I've had with the phone itself was when I first got it. It took some time for the phone to recognize my SIM card. That was a bit frustrating, but once solved, the issue never arose again. I will say, though, that if you need to use two SIM cards, you will be unable to use a micro SD as the Micro SD and one of the SIM slots are the same slot. For me, it's no issue as I only need one SIM, but I felt it worth mentioning. The phone has 32 GB of internal space, which is more than enough for me, so I don't even need to use my SD card.There are better phones out there, obviously. But you'll be spending at least $600 to get them. This phone is way too good for the price. Thank you again, BLU, for an amazing product."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",21-Apr-17,5,Great phone5(+++,Great phone husband says it's better then his I phone 6s n that's a supprise it way faster n has many more great things u can figure out on ur phone it's compatible w strait talk n at a well.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-Mar-18,4,I absolutely love this! I don't normally do a review so ...,"I absolutely love this! I don't normally do a review so soon (after only two days). However, this has exceeded my expectations to the point that if anything went wrong at this point, it would still be a winner in my book. Where do I start? I'll start off with the bad. I didn't care for the launcher that they use. It's very juvenile. But I always use Microsoft launcher anyway, so it wasn't a big deal. The launcher that it comes with places all of your apps on the screen. Ew! But, as I said before, that's an easy fix! I love the fact that almost everything you need is on the phone without a million and one apps. You got your barcode scanner in your camera app. Someone should have thought of that ago. You also have the option to record phone calls through your regular call app. Never saw that before. Back to the camera. It's awesome for such a low budget phone! It's almost too good! Normally your front-facing cameras don't catch your pores so well. I'll be using touch up features for that part. Lol! I love the business card scan option. It lets you scan business cards into your contacts. The free updates to Nougat didn't go so well though! Tried everything but had to factory reset. That wasn't fun. The 3GB of temporary memory is everything! I never knew that was the reason my old phone wouldn't load content very well. I thought it was my data usage allowance giving me hell! The speaker is on the back. But, honestly, who plays media through the phone speaker anymore? It's a nice-sized phone with a pretty sleek design! The charger that comes with it charges pretty decent. However, battery life could be a little better! I live with chargers all around me. So, it's not a problem for me. Kinda comes with the territory. I haven't been able to find how to make the battery notification tell me my percentage yet. I'll keep looking. The option to ""close all"" at the recent task menu is everything! It keeps the phone clean and working fast without the hassle of swiping then one by one all of the time! I've said enough. This phone is worth it!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",9-Mar-18,4,"Good phone, disastrous update to Android 7","i have been very happy with this phone. UNTIL I gave in to the nagging and updated to Android 7. It deleted all my photos and downloaded PDFs, created strange-looking, strangely colored icons, deleted all my home screen bookmarks, made several apps unusable, and corrupted my 64 GB SD card so that it was unreadable either in the phone or on a PC and I had to throw it out. I had to restore the phone, which then automatically updated to Android 7. If you want to update to Android 7, back up all your data to a computer (i tried to back up to the SD card but couldn't do the PDFs or screen shots), remove the SD card, and restore the phone. Otherwise the phone works well and has a strong broadcast signal that I use as a hotspot with great success."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",26-Nov-17,5,Fantastic!,"BLU has become my new favorite. The camera is fantastic, it's easy to customize and comes with great preinstalled apps such as the Amazon app. The phone is easy to navigate and has terific battery life. The first phone I got had some blue tooth issues, but that went away with an update. (I got a new one because my son decided mine needed to be a fish. My second one did not have any Bluetooth problems at all) Also when I got my first one (almost 6 months before this review) there weren't alot of case options. Now there are quite a few unique case designs. I think BLU is a fantastic product and also decently priced. I've fallen in love. When it's time for me to upgrade I will go BLU."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Aug-17,5,I love this phone,"I love this phone. I have had it for over 6 months now, and the performance and features are awesome. I recommended it to my brother, and he bought one and feels the same. The value of this phone is incredible. The phone is very attractive and slim with a large display. It offers so much at  a great price point. I tell everyone about BLU now, and no one I know has ever heard of them, but when I show them what a great phone I have, they want to know more. This is a great American product."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Apr-17,3,It's OK,"Liked it at first, but there's really no accessories out there and they've been in the news at least twice for having spyware in the firmware"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-Jul-17,4,I love this phone,"I love this phone. It has a lot of features and it is better than I expected. I have had it for a while now and I am pleased. I think the picture quality could be better. If taking flawless pics is important for you then this phone may not be for you. However the phone is fast and the screen is the perfect size for me. I have has situations where the phone freezes and I have to close application running in the background or restart. Overall, I love this phone and I would recommend it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",12-Jan-18,4,Good phone,"First time purchase of the BLU brand I came from Samsung and was looking for a phone that could handle my rough use everyday. The phone is sleek comfortable in your hands. It comes with headphones and adapter for USB a rubber case and a charger.Pros: large display, fast reaction on the keyboard.  Has 20Gb of true internal storage. The rest is preloaded apps that are embedded in to the store. Operating system is good no glitches and very responsive to the Android platformCons: no expansion on memory the speaker is located on the back side away from you. So if you watching a YouTube video on a table the sound may be muffled.Overall the device is a good product price point is Affordable and I received the phone probably in the mail with no issues. Try it out."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",31-May-17,4,has other irritating issues but won't waste my time on those,"Several issues with phone, one the gold glaze color makes it hard to see the square, circle, and back arrow in light and no light, has other irritating issues but won't waste my time on those.  Could have been better engineered.  Missed my calling I guess."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",21-Jul-17,5,I love this phone,"I love this phone. I have had it for quite awhile now and haven't had any problems. It looks good, it is very responsive and it takes pretty good pictures. Oh, and it makes phone calls. LOL. Seriously, I my last 3 phones have been BLU phones and I have never been disappointed. My only complaint is that the battery is not replaceable. But I guess by the time the battery starts to fail, I will be ready for an upgrade anyway."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-May-17,5,That's the best part it last me allday,"I dont know why people are bashing the battery? That's the best part it last me allday. And its not like I dont use it i actually do alot on it and the battery last. The battery is even better than the BLU energy x2 I had. This is honestly the best phone I ever had. Plenty of storage space. It works very fast. Does not lag. You would think I paid more for it, My wife loves it too. Im happy with my purchase. I waited more than a month to write this review because I was waiting to see If the battery gives out."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",7-Aug-17,5,Excellent,So I've owed this phone for going on 6 months.  I use Stright talks AT&T sim (bring you own phone).  This phone is buy far the best phone I've ever owned besises my all time favorite LG Optims Q.  Blu Vivio XL 2 is extremly fast it out runs my sisters new s7 which is crazy $700 phone.  well atleast my blu runs that fast cant say that for the others.  No isues with my phone would buy again!
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",13-Feb-18,4,Good bang for the buck,"This is the 2nd Vivo XL2 I bought. The first one I dropped and shattered the screen a month after I bought it. For the price the phone is a keeper. Why pay $1000. for a phone your probably going to replace in a couple years anyway. I have had no issuses with this phone. Two days after I bought it it updated to Android 7.0. I did however switch from the BLU Carefree launcher, which I didn't like, to the Google launcher. This is the 4th BLU phone I have bought and this one is my favorite."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",11-Apr-17,5,Great phones. Speedy response times when switching apps,"Great phones. Speedy response times when switching apps, downloading, surfing the internet. Very happy with this purchase. Never hard of BLU before did some research, great bang for the buck. You won't be sorry."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",15-Jan-18,5,Like all phones,"Been using this phone for about 8 months now.  Like all phones, it has it's pluses and minuses.  All in all, it does what I need it to do, so I'm satisfied with it.  Battery life is about 8 to 12 hours depending on how you use your phone.  If you play games, on social networks, etc.  It has the tendency to drain the battery quickly, but you can recharge the phone with the wall charger in about an hour.  Car charger takes a bit longer."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",18-Feb-18,5,A Great Smartphone!!,"Love this phone which is exactly like a Samsung right down to the toughness of the case, gorilla glass and inner software. Have used with 2 SIMS in different countries and also one SIM and a memory card. Android 7.0 (Nougat) update just downloaded easily and I have a Windows overlay installed which works seamlessly. Battery still going strong and easy charge. I'd buy another BLU phone in a heartbeat. Unbelievable value."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-Sep-17,1,Charging port issues,There are several things I don't like about this phone. However I will list the pros and consPros:-Large display-Very bright-Virtually no lag with normal everyday use-Large battery lasts me all day on one charge with light to medium usage-The cameras are decent.Cons:-LACK OF APP DRAWER(seeing all my apps on multiple screens is less desirable. Not to mention ugly since they are not in any specific order. A custom launcher is warranted.)-Less than adequate speaker.-bloatware(never had bloatware on Blu before)-Tends to heat up in the pocket with the screen off.-Home and navigation buttons are too small. I find myself having to press one of them several times before it registers the action.Update 9/23/2017:Phone will no longer connect to WiFi unless I reset my router first. Even with the most recent wireless update. This is a major concern considering what I paid for this device.Update 3/17/18:Phone is almost completely useless now. The charging port is broken or loosened. I can no longer use the device while charging. The slightest movement disconnects the charger.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-Nov-17,5,An AWESOME CELLPHONE.,"Unlocked, dual SIM ( well, that is if you don't install a micro memory card, but then again, the phone's memory is big enough so you don't need additional memory anyway ). Beautiful screen resolution and fast response when switching between applications. This cellphone is a perfect blend of utility, size and bang for your dollar. Blu cellphones are awesome. This is my second Vivo XL and my next, will also Bea Blu device.Highly recommended phone, just make sure you get it from this seller. It arrived well packed and sooner than expected."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Mar-18,3,Started having issues after android update,"I bought the phone on July 2017, so I have had it for the last 8 months. The phone was great initially, very good performance for the price. Camera was decent. However, after I updated to Android 7.0, it started having multiple problems. First the microphone stopped working, I got it fixed by turning off Google voice assistant. However, it still has a ghost-touch issue where the phone keeps exiting from apps or switches between apps without user input. In addition the battery life is now much worse than before.This is my first Blu phone and I don't think I will ever buy from them again."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",14-Jul-17,5,Great Phone,"I was looking at replacing my older BLU with a Samsung or iPhone, the cost of the these phones are out of control. This BLU does everything I need plus more. Glad I stayed with the BLU line. Really like the encrypt feature for photos, took me a minute or two to figure it out."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-Apr-17,1,PISSED OFF LOYAL BLU CUSTOMER,I brought this phone for my son a little over a month and already an having problems with it!  My son was charging the phone and we started to smell something burning. Went into his room where the phone was plugged up and the charging port on the phone was smoking!  Now the port is all burnt out and unable to charge and i can't even get a refund for the phone!  This is ridiculous cause this is the fourth Blu I have brought that has malfunctioned in a short time. I am really disappointed in their products lately and they always seem to act up when it's past the return period.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",17-Mar-18,1,Adware/spyware,Phone works fine but the battery drains faster than any phone I've had in the last 5 years.I removed all of the apps the came with it. After 5 days I'm starting to get ads for apps in my notifications. The apps are known to not be safe. A quick Google search will show a history of problems with this phone coming with spyware. For that reason alone I cannot recommend the phone. Not happy2nd update: 10 days later the phone is now randomly powering off. battery was not low. both times today it was above 40% there's now more spyware as well. returning this garbage
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Dec-17,4,... brand cell phones and the Vivo line is the best so far,I've tried a few different BLU brand cell phones and the Vivo line is the best so far. They seem to last the longest and are the most user friendly. This particular Vivo XL2 is a great phone for the price.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",26-Apr-17,2,Phone has built in malware. Be careful,Please note after activating my Antivirus on the phone it detected a malware. (Android communication sync). Believe it or not it actually came with the phone. Despite my best efforts I am unable to disable or remove this malware. So disappointed.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",13-Sep-17,4,I like BLU phones and this is one of the good ones.,"A really nice phone for the money. I'd give it 5 stars if BLU would promise an Android 7 update. It needs a case, as the back will scratch without it and it likes to slip our of your pocket when you get in the car."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",12-Sep-17,5,Great quality phone for the money.,Purchased this for my son as I am still using Vivo 5.  Trick to keep it working is to power it off and back on daily and great phone for the money.  The  camera is better than the Iphone cameras.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Nov-17,5,"Love this phone, my 2nd one-beats the local cell shop phone pricing.","For a 5.5 inch Screen 4G phone with Android, awesome price and great functionality.  This is my second purchase of BLU VIVO XL2.  Only caution is that you should exercise caution plugging charger into phone.  Jack is not well soldered to board. Careful use will not damage, or find your best techie friend to resolder to board."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Oct-17,3,Eeeehhhhh......,"Started off great. Bought in March, so 7mths in & now the screen is coming off the phone. It started acting possessed about 3 months ago; backing out of things, turning off, starting apps. It was weird, but manageable. I'm not rough with my phone, it has a case & screen protector. I haven't dropped it or gotten it wet. Lots of space to store things & with a 16g SD card I still have over 2/3 of storage left (I have a lot of songs, movies, apps) other than the phone now falling apart with no reason & no response from Blu it was a good phone. Still think the Blu Energy was the BEST from them"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Nov-17,5,good phone nice price,I love my Blu phone wouldn't own any other brand and you can't go wrong for price it takes crisp sharp pics and it's fast I even dropped it a couple of times on the glass side it didn't break. Some of you gave it a bad review because it didn't work right but don't forget it's massed produced like anything else that's why you have a warranty either give it another shot or get your money back it's up to you.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",2-Apr-17,5,I recommend this phone,I Love Love my new phone. The finish on the back is real nice. It also comes with a protective clear case for the back side. One of my daughter's has an Apple phone and she says she likes mine better. Activating this phone was actually quite easy.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-Apr-17,5,Great phone,"Really like my phone. Most expensive one I've ever bought but so far it's worth it. It's super fast and responsive. No lags or freezes. Good layout, some things a little quirky but nothing bad. Call quality and signal great, very lightweight and camera pretty good too"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",6-Mar-18,4,Beautiful phone. Very nice and it arrived fast,Beautiful phone. Very nice and it arrived fast. The only problem as soon as it was in contact with water it stopped working. I know it’s not water proof but some phones still work after being in contact with water. Not this one. Other than that great phone for the price. Nice quality.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Mar-17,3,Fragile Glass,"Not sure what Gorilla Glass is used for but dropped this from 12""-14"" on to linoleum and the screen shattered easier than the dreams of freedom of a death row inmate.Love the phone, only had it two days but it's been flawless on every level (wish I could say the same and not dropped the damn thing), except the glass. Gorilla Glass doesn't seem to be any stronger than other screen glass.I'm glad they included an extra screen protector, needed it to keep the pieces of glass in place so it's still somewhat functional."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-Aug-17,4,Screen freezing!!,"Very good purchase however, after two months...the screen started freezing and doing its own thing. Contacted Blu...they recommended a hard factory reset...Problem still exist. They asked that I send it back to them for repairs. Unable to send mine because I don't have a spare phone to use. Hopefully, they can find the problem and send out an automatic update."

It is reliable, fast, almost and exact replica of the Galaxy that I had and so much more affordable. I would buy this product again, well done BLU"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",6-Oct-17,4,Pretty good phone,I really like this phone.  It has great reception (using 4g/lte on Tmobile).  Worth it for the price.  And not a bad alternative if you don't want to shell out $600 for a phone.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Mar-17,5,So far so good.,"I received this product yesterday. The product is very solid and to my surprised, looked premium although it cost only $150. So far so good. Updating my review. This phone connects to T-Mobile 4G LTE signal. Very happy with it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",7-Sep-17,1,Amazon return service excellent. will not buy this brand,"the phone download an app "" american hawaii Bank‘  for me without my knowledge, called some one without my knowledge three times in 3 mins today. bought this phone new from amazon  , not other seller. not know whether it can be returned , called amazon.  Amazon return service excellent.  will not buy this brand.a lot app preinstalled by BLU.  when I set the pin, it become very difficult to operate. without pin, it run ok, but very easy to freeze.  1.7 G Ram used when not open any of your own app."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",13-Jun-17,3,Not bad but not great either,"Ok, I have had this phone for a few months now and I like it but dont love it. Nice screen size, the resolution doesnt bother me in the slightest. My issues are all evolved around mem and cpu.  Get into any intensive graphics and you get a lot of slow down. Its not really a gaming phone.Now here are the issues I have on a constant basis. Apps closing for no reason. You go into them, and before you can do anything the app may just shut down on you. try again and this time it works. This behavior happens with several apps and games.The latest update which came out a week or so ago introduced Ads into the remote control app which is stock with the phone and I didnt even use it but boom, all kinds of ads coming up every day. Had to disable the app (you cant uninstall it) and uninstall the apps update in order to get rid of the ads. Come on, who wants ads on their phone? Blue help app has also started throwing up some ads as well. You are already using lesser hardware to make the phone cheap, do we really need ads added? Come on BLU, get your act together on this. I took away a full star for adding these ads into the default apps that come on the phone.Other random issues. You get a news update, if it sets there for more than say 20 minutes and you finally tap on it to read it, it opens the opera browser, goes to the article and displays a blank page. If you open up another tab you can see the first tab populated but as soon as you go back to it, its blank again. If you read the news alerts right away, they work perfectly fine and display like they are supposed to.There are lots of little software glitches like this on this phone. It can be very annoying at times. If you just need a phone with a few apps to get you by, I would recommend this phone. If you want to make this phone your primary internet device, stay far away from it. Just way to glitchy and to slow. Im not sorry I bought it, I needed a tide me over till the note 8 comes out and this is working for me despite the issues."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-Oct-17,4,I would've given it 5 stars but...,"This is a GREAT phone for the money.  32g of data, 2g of RAM, awesome camera with GREAT resolution, but not so great at night.  Otherwise, best bang for the buck!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",17-Dec-17,4,"The camera is lacking, but the price is worth it...!!!","It's a simple, basic phone that does a decent job! The camera isn't a great as I thought it would be. (I picked this phone because its camera specs matched up to my old phone's camera, but it is definitely not on the same par...) Also, there are minimal widgets and no VIEWABLE clipboard. I was very spoiled by my last phone (LG G FLEX 2)...BUT....For the price, the BLU VIVO XL2 is completely worth it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Sep-17,5,Love it,Great phone. RAM memory makes a huge difference and the 32gb of internal memory makes it all easy. Great phone for a fair price.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",14-Mar-17,5,Works on Ting Wireless for all services!,Great phone for the money. Flagship looks. The volume from callers is a little low and the camera performance are the only cons I can think of.  I bought another one because I liked this one.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",12-Sep-17,5,Hope this one last,Lovin it. Found a hard cover to fit. I always break my screen. Then I turn it  into a radio for work and my grandkids use it for youtube with wifi

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",12-Dec-17,5,Highly Recommend!,"This phone has been amazing! As someone who has been on the search for a long time for an affordable phone, I finally found one! I've had this phone since March of 2017, and it's been amazing ever since! It has all the perks of an expensive phone including lots of RAM, lots of storage, huge screen, great cameras, and on top of all of that, it's unlocked!Great purchase, highly recommend for others."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",12-Jul-17,5,Hope it upgrades to Android Nougat,"Purchased for my sister last week when the operating system on her Galaxy Note 4 crashed. Says she loves it, but of course misses having an s-pen. Otherwise is enjoying it & hopes that it upgrades to Android Nougat (came with Marshmallow)."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-Jun-17,5,Can't beat BLU.,"Better than expected. With 32 gb internal storage and 3 gb ram plus other features, you can't beat this phone and the price at 148 dollars makes it the best deal for a phone out there."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",18-Mar-18,1,This phone is not worth buying.,"This is the worst Blu phone I've ever bought.  I bought it for my niece in Trinidad, the first thing she noticed is that it gets overheated very quickly.  after about 2 mths the volume went, the phone would not ring at all. I had to laugh when she told me the phone is possessed  without her touching the phone it would start opening different apps.  being that i sent it abroad i had to cut my losses $149.99."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-Nov-17,5,I definitely recommend this phone,This is a great phone. There is a learning curve since I switched from an iPhone but it is a good phone.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",18-Mar-18,1,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME,"DO NOT PURCHASE! WARNING DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I bought this phone just a little over a month ago. I can not make phone calls from it now. When it first happened I thought maybe it was because my phone hadn't been shut off or rebooted for awhile, so I did that. Then it happened again. Same thing, after reboot did okay. Today it was acting up and I had restarted my phone just an hour or so ago. My return time just ended a few days ago. It looks like I wasted my money and will be looking for a new phone."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",11-Mar-18,5,Better than iPhone,Love these phones!  I ordered the original XL and loved it so when my hubby and I needed new phones I ordered these. Very happy with them!  Fast and full of space!  Bright clear screen and fast app activity!
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",14-Mar-17,5,BLU are the words I say and what I think,"I've had this product for 6 days now and regret I didn't get this phone before I bought the iPhone 6 Plus a year ago. After six days of use, I can honestly say that this phone takes the punishment and keeps performing like a soldier. I already dropped this phone on accident (during a hand-off to my son) on concrete and thanks to the silicone case that came with this phone by default, there are no visible scratches or nicks and the phone's functionality has not suffered one bit. I've always been partial to Android OS and have not been disappointed since I made the switch from the Apple iOS to Android. It came with a screen protector on the phone already yet it came with a second one as a replacement. It also came with a silicone case, head-buds that sounds really good, fast charger and a beautiful box to stuff all these accessories in it. For $149.00 I got a hell of a bargain. I didn't have to purchase additional accessories like you would with other new phone purchases. I have people asking me about this phone consistently as it looks very pleasing to the eye. I didn't get this phone as a fashion statement, I got it because of the strong functionality that it kicks out. I'm not sure why other consumers have claimed they have had negative experiences (maybe because they are the competition) and they see this phone as a threat to their bottom line. Either way, if all you care about is a solid phone that does what you want it to do, that functions as smoothly as it looks....I advise you get it!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-Mar-18,1,Don't buy this phone,"This phone seemed good for a few months, then it went bad.  It randomly vibrates and exits apps and generally became unusable.  I googled around and found out this is a very common problem with this phone.  If you plan to keep the phone more than a couple of months, this is not the one to get."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-Dec-17,5,Great phone,"This phone costs 145 dollars.  Guess what?  It's a great phone!  I feel absolutely comfortable recommending this phone.  It does not have some of the bells and whistles of an 800 phone.  For me, it's perfect"

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-May-17,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this phone, but had to return it. Not their fault.","I loved it but I had to return it because I had Net10 and used Verizon through them. If --- in the last three months or so -- your service has gone from good (or great) to cruddy on Net10, you need to be aware that (according to the customer service rep I spoke to for 2.5 hours about the problem)  the Verizon folks ""upgraded"" their tower equipment to CDMA and this is a GSM phone that would no longer work with the closest tower. It did reach out beyond the closest and sometimes get me service, but it was patchy and unreliable. IF the tower had remained GSM this phone would have been a real winner for me. I loved it. But, due to the service provider's change, it didn't work out for me. I wish it had. I wound up with an iPhone 5s and I prefer this one. BLU, however, (I also spoke to them about their phones)  doesn't have any CDMA phones, unfortunately. I told them to fix that."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",26-Apr-17,4,Easy to use,This phone has been working well for me. It has plenty of storage for all your apps and music. Easy to use. It's almost perfect. I think the Blu help support could be better. You download the manual and it is not great.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",29-Mar-17,1,BEWARE: this Phone comes preloaded with SPYWARE,"The phone itself is decent and a great price however it comes preloaded with Chinese SPYWARE. For that reason, I can't recommend it.  Blu phones are rebranded from Gionee in China. The spyware is installed as a system app, which was discovered by running the Malwarebytes program and confirmed as such by other Android security sites.  So far this phone has been impossible to root.  I have ways to disable spyware but it's not something the average person knows how to do or is even aware of. Amazon should not be selling this phone until the issue is resolved."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",2-Apr-17,5,Good phone,"Knowing I was coming from an iPhone I was actually expecting this phone to be awful. Aside from having to get used to a few differences, this phone is really good so far. A few things I still need to figure out but otherwise it is just as fast and just as good as my iPhone 6s. I do love how long the battery lasts but I do hate how much longer it takes to charge. I was very nervous switching but this phone has made it relatively painless."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",29-Jun-17,1,Strike 2,I really loved this phone when written on paper. Once you've got it at up you realize how unreliable it is. Yes it has a great camera and great storage but I have to constantly restart my phone and my Hotspot connection. I had such high hopes. You get what you pay for though. It didn't hurt that the only case I could find at the time fell apart after a week of use. I really really wish this s an awesome phone. It's just so unreliable that I can't stand behind it.

Phone worked fine for about three days then started locking up/freezing. Apps quit working. Some worked temporarily after deleting and reloading but not all.  Wouldn't keep sync'd with my email accts. Sometimes ringer worked, other times only way I knew I'd had a call was the missed call notice.  Frustrating as the phone is the same one my son has had for almost a year now and his has worked perfectly the entire time he's owned it.  It's why I chose this model Blu.  Returned it to Amazon who as usual are the absolute best to buy from with their no hassle returns and instant refunds.  Would have loved the phone if Blu had any quality control on their products and it performed like my son's."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-May-17,5,Love this phone,I've had this phone for about a month and I have zero problems and no funtional issues with the phone. The out of the box theme is a huge learning curve but I just installed a new theme pack so I don't count that as a negative.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",4-May-17,3,Needs improved,Freezes up and kicks you back to the home screen a lot
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-Jan-18,3,If you want a temporary phone lasted less than a year,"This phone is terrible I purchased 3 one for my son daughter and myself and all near the same time our phones begin to act crazy. I've since contacted the company and left a voice message and I have not received a return call. So sadly to say I had to order me a new phone,  no it is not a blu product. I would never purchase another blu phone. The body of the phone looks nice but the apps and the services and it is not worth having this phone. I'll go on YouTube or open up an app and it would just shut me out and go back to my home screen. The other thing that it does is that her freezes and you have to power off and power on and then the phone response and what you were trying to do that's not right so as a result of all of this this will be my last blu phone ever. Don't purchase it. Also went through a major update on Saturday the phone updated all of our phones and that only made matters worse my alarm clock doesn't work the way it was my phone I have it set to automatically shut off and come on it set the time up to what it wanted to, all of the beautiful colors are gone out of it like in my contacts each person's name was in a different color circle and it would have liked their initial of their first name and I thought that was really cool now it's just a gray and white and just looks dreary and just I'm not pleased with the update or the phone. Do not purchase this phone if you wanted more than one year because I've had a less than that all three of us and all of them are gone they're terrible."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-Mar-17,3,Great Smartphone at a Great Price!,"I've had this phone since the release date. So far I absolutely love the Vivo XL2! Out of the box I installed my ATT sim card and SD card, powered it up, transferred my apps and contacts from my old phone and I was ready to go. It loads apps quickly and much more efficiently than my old LG G3.The battery life is fantastic. Again, my old phone was good for six hours before it needed a charge (15% battery remaining), and that was with the screen dimmed and minimal usage. With moderate use and decent screen intensity I can go for 10-12 hours before it gets to 20%.The camera is decent although lacking in some features, such as panoramic view and slow motion video. But for the price I'm willing to overlook it. Picture quality is better than most phones were just a few short years ago.For my purposes there are two shortfalls with this phone. First, there is no Near Field Communication, so Android Pay is a no go. I was big on Android Pay with my old device, so it was an adjustment going to this phone. Second is the availability of cases. With the exception of the flimsy rubber case included, there are no cases available for this phone. I hope this situation takes care of itself soon.Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase.Update:Shortly after my review the phone started giving me serious issues with the touchscreen. For no reason the phone will roll back through all the previous screens in the app being used until it goes into the home screen edit mode. If you hit the home button Google comes up then the phone returns to the edit mode. Only way to get out of this state is to shut the phone off and on. Returned it to Blu (it was out of my possession for a month!) and it still gives me issues. I emailed them and they want me to do a hard reboot again, which didn't work in the past.To their credit Blu did replace it with a new phone."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Aug-17,4,Great Device!,"I am a 1st time BLU user and I have no complaints thus far.  This device is definitely an upgrade from my previous device (PLUM).  The sleekness and gold color give it a high-end look and I am loving the features - 32GB storage, picture quality, etc."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-Sep-17,3,"I love this phone, but I hate the charging issues","I totally love this phone. I've been rocking it for a good 6-7 months at this point. It would be the perfect phone for me if it wasn't for issues with charging. I've looked into it but it seems like this is a pretty common problem for this phone. The charging port is not working correctly and is getting worse and worse. I'm not rough on my phone so I feel like this shouldn't be an issue. It also sometimes does this thing where the battery life will suddenly dive and the numbers on the charge will tick down in seconds. With that problem, it sounded more like a software issue rather than the battery, but I'm not 100% sure. The battery life overall seems to be poor compared to where it used to be. If wireless charging were supported that would be cool.Other than those issues I really do love this phone. The screen size, the speed, and the functionality of the phone is awesome. Looks like I might have to dig through warranty things and see if it can be fixed."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Jan-18,1,Poor Phone + Poor Customer Service = Poor Review,"Purchased the phone Sept. 2017, and by Nov. 2017 it had become totally unstable. It started toggling between apps or closing programs as if the phone was possessed. I contacted customer service, and they had me walk through a bunch of unnecessary steps. Each time I did what they told me to do, I had to hang up and call back into the queue. After doing this about 4 or 5 times, they finally told me to send the phone in. They said it would take 20 days to fix (IF they decide to fix it). I send it in, and they tell me there's something wrong with the calibration. They then go on to tell me ""the only way this could happen is if you drooped the phone, so we won't be covering it under warranty"". I know for a FACT that I never dropped this phone. I also know for a FACT that I will never order this phone again or recommend it to anyone else for purchase. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EVERYTHING!"

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",13-Dec-17,3,"BLU tells you the good, Here's the bad...","Lots of little annoying things about this phone! As you can read on the specs of it, yes, the hardware and software on it is pretty cool for the price. But lots of things it CAN'T do. Such as:1) You cannot have different ringtones for different things. You can have a ringtone for calls, and then a tone for ""Notifications"". ""Notifications"" means email, text, and notification. Facebook fortunately has it's own tone built into their app, but I cannot set different tones for email or text message. So a single sound goes off and I don't know if it's an email or text message. NO WAY to change this!2) It comes with several built in apps that you cannot delete, and I bought mine unlocked.3) There is a TINY ""key"" that comes with the phone that opens the slot for SIM or SD cards. If you lose that, it'll be difficult to get into your phone.4) Speaking of SIM and SD cards, if you put an SD card in, you cannot use the dual SIM option.5) There is no built-in calendar. I had to download an app to display my Google calendar as a monthly calendar on one screen.6) It CONSTANTLY asks permission for every single app! And if you say yes, it still wants to take you to your settings and tells you to remove the ""Overwrite apps"" option....I do and it just resets a lot of times and keeps asking me?!? I've never had a phone ask for permissions to draw over other apps on every single app almost every single time! It's really annoying!This phone is quickly becoming not worth the cheap price. It works okay, but has lots of annoying little quirks that you have to download other apps to fix or just deal with. And the whole reason I bought this phone was for the storage capability."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",4-Mar-17,4,Good budget friendly phone,"This phone is awesome. Its perfect for people on a budget and it runs pretty good. I do however experience some lag here and there when I try to switch the rear cam to the front facing cam. A reboot fixed that, but I'm concerned it will do that again and I'm not so happy to reboot every time that happens. I don't use the camera much, but I just wanted to let everyone know about that issue. The default android on it is a bit plain so I suggest you put Nova Launcher on it to make it more personalized. I like that it comes with a case, a screen protector already on it so you don't have to worry about putting it on yourself and an extra screen protector with earphones and the charging cord. Overall, its a good phone to buy if you are just coming in to android or if you can't afford a higher end phone."

Also supports Bluetooth connection (currently have my Bluetooth ...,"This phone caught me by surprise on how Decent (Quality wise) and how well it's performance is. I have had two Blu phones, first one did not have LTE for Cricket (At&t Co), this one does and I have brought it up North (Canada) and had 4G coverage with more than decent speeds. So far it DOES recognize 128gb micro SD cards, but be warned mines REQUIRED formatting (back up your data!!) The call quality is very good. Also supports Bluetooth connection (currently have my Bluetooth headphones connected, no issues). Also has Limited LED notification. I'm giving 5 starts not because it is a perfect phone (by no means it is), I'm giving it 5 stars for everything it delivers for the money your paying (bang for your buck)Camera - your back camera will look like your front (selfie) camera... Which is not really a good thing considering the back is supposed to have a higher megapixel count. Pictures get degraded once you zoom in. The Video by Contrast is actually VERY good and sharp (not sure why still photos don't mirror this)Battery - pretty solid. While it won't get you by a whole day of heavy usage without charging (youtube, Netflix, Google maps .....Amazon etc...), You will find that with heavy usage your phone will not Drain as quickly as you might expect and holds up pretty well. For an avg user (texting, occasional video) a day or more will suffice. Bonus: I have not experienced the back getting hot during heavy usage or accessing my rather extensive media content on my DAD card.Memory - As mentioned above, it recognized (after formatting) my 128gb SD. The Added 32 internal GB (use primarily for apps and updates) comes in handy and allows for you to obtain apps and app updates with out causing your phone to slow down from clutter. The 3gb ram also is Very Good for this.Ui - Blu's Ui and ......added ware is not really an issue and I sectionalized all of their icons to the last screen. Though I will mention their initial access screen (prior to lock screen) does have it's moments in accessing your camera or home page quickly...........yeh it has its momentsSpeaker - At best, the speaker is not the best. Do not be in a busy room and expect your peers to hear the sound on a video your showing with clarity.Leftouts - for those that care about these features, unfortunately the phone lacks the following:- Removable battery- Finger print scanner- Heart rate monitorSummary:For $149 this phone delivers what you need AND what you want and then some. It is an economic phone that brings near flagship quality to the table. You won't get everything, but you will get a lot for your money. While falling short of Apple or Samsung Expectations, you really could not ask for a better [Economic] phone.*Paid Full price with my own money*No promotion or sample given"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-Mar-17,1,Dead after a week normal usage,"Used it for a week, never played any game, just surfing website, phone battery level was low and eventually shut down itself. But then unable to turn on the screen after charged, all I got was just vibrating sounds when pressing power switch, screen dead. Unfortunately, this phone battery is built-in, no way to detach and place the battery back for reset.Additionally, the system did not run as fast as what other reviewers comment. The camera unable to focus as quickly as expected, the night quality was nothing really fine.For the phone calls, people complaining not clear, cannot hear etc.There have more better choices out there if you do not mind paying little bit more, at least save you hassle to deal with Blu customer service later IMO.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Feb-17,5,"Beware of ""Ghost apps""!","I waited a couple of weeks after purchasing my BLU Vivo XL2 to write this review, so I could use it for a while before reviewing it. I love this phone! The screen is large and my videos and photos appear crystal clear and vivid. It took very little time to get my phone up and running: after I figured out how to insert my SIM card and my SD card, I was able to load all my contacts and my apps. Installation of everything was fast and easy.My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy 5, and after just paying it off, the external speaker died. My husband's Galaxy 5 quit before mine did, so neither of us was happy about that or willing to replace it with the newest, $700 version. After doing research and reading reviews of all the options on Amazon, I decided to give this BLU phone a chance. From my experience with it so far, I can say that the BLU Vivo XL2 is the best phone you're ever going to get for such a low price. Honestly, I see no difference between my BLU phone and the Samsung I had before, and in fact the screen on my BLU is bigger, making it feel like a nice upgrade.I use my phone for the typical purposes: taking photos, reading email, texting, surfing the net, listening to music, and downloading documents to read and edit them. I am an educator, not a business person, so that may make a difference in my cell phone needs. Anyone who believes that the only good phones are made by Apple or Samsung, and who think you get that much ""more"" for the additional $500 or $600 will probably find things to complain about; but coming from the Galaxy 5 to this phone, I can easily say BLU has it beat.I was not a big fan of the app layout: the BLU doesn't come with an app drawer where you can put the apps you don't use often. But you can just download Nova Launcher, set up your home screen and apps the way you like, and you're all set.My only regret about this phone is that I didn't purchase it the week before, when there was a $99 flash sale. At the $149 I paid for this excellent phone, I got a great deal. At $99, it would be a steal!A recommendation: When you buy the phone, get the insurance plan. At $25 for 2 years, it's well worth it. It covers for water damage, broken screen, battery malfunction...all the common damages. I've dropped my phone a couple of times and so far, so good. But for the extra $25, it's worth it to know my phone will be replaced if I damage it.UPDATE (February 20, 2018):After having the phone for less than a year, and returning it twice for replacement and repair, I have decided to give up on it. It's unfortunate, since the phone could be great for the price. But the constant glitching, the ""ghost apps"" opening and closing on their own, is driving me crazy. BLU accepted the phone for repair under warranty, but the customer service was bad: no one ever contacted me to explain what was wrong with the phone; they shipped it back without any information regarding what they did to repair it. And the phone is still glitching. I ordered a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone and once it arrives I'm parting ways with this BLU phone!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",11-Dec-17,4,I really like these Blu phones,"I really like these Blu phones, just like with every phone it take a little getting use to. One thing you might want to know is Netflix will not install on  unlocked phones. Not a huge deal. But nice to know."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-Aug-17,5,Five Stars,Perfect phone for a teenager as the price is low but the photo quality is pretty good.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Oct-17,1,"Yes, I fell for it, but you don't have to...","Price seemed right, so I guess I took a shot... I assume many of you will read this and all the other reviews, good and bad, then do the same,  hoping you will be the lucky one.  It's sort of like a $160 lottery.  My advice: pay a few extra dollars, get a Samsung or some real brand and be finished with it.  I had a Samsung for a few years, was as good as new (I'm not into upgrading phones all the time, just not that important to me)... but my carrier (T-Mob) upgraded its network and I HAD to switch.  Checked everything, and the Blu seemed to have the basic features and speed I need.  Watched the video with some pseudo-geek opening the box and blathering about all kinds of statistics. Fine, I'm sold.The phone seemed to work fine at first, had to get used to the UI, which is never fun, but after a couple of weeks I had it figured out.  Reloaded my apps and seemed to be in good shape.  Nothing startling about the performance, the ""long battery life & fast charging"" didn't come true true but I really didn't care; I'm usually in a car and charge overnight so that is not a big issue with me (btw you can't change the battery).So here I am, just a couple of days shy of 3 months and out of the blue (no pun intended) the phone just stopped charging.  No drops, shocks, voltage spikes, etc etc. - just pfft - and it doesn't charge.  Unplug and re-plug and it starts to charge for like 30 seconds then stops; 3 different charges, 3 different cables, yeah, its the phone.  Go to my Amazon account and there is no ""return"" option for this device, slightly getting that sinking feeling... contacted the manufacturer.  After the customary overseas call-center ""thank you for that information"" (stop saying that!) and ""Yes I understand sir"" conversation, the result is I have to mail the phone to them and they will repair or replace with a new phone... in *10 to 15 days*.  Now, I don't know about you, but I simply cannot go for 15 days without my phone; I use it to conduct my business; waiting for 15 days is not an option.  Of course, I tried reasoning with the ""manager"" - you've been there - who repeated the exact same ""we can only follow our standard return procedure"" answer to every futile attempt I made to speed up the process. (Please, lady, at least say it slightly differently each time, try and make it sound like you're actually listening.)So I'm going to send in my phone and hope I'm the 9 day guy and not the 15 day guy (talk about lowering expectations) and have to make the decision if I double down on this disaster... Do I go and buy a REAL phone, or buy a flip-phone or some cheap alternative to fill the gap and keep as a backup for the next time -  and there WILL be a next time - I have to send the phone back?  Probably going with the REAL phone, because eventually this phone will be out of whatever warranty is covering me for this serviceSo, undoubtedly many of you who have read this far are still going to roll the dice - like I did.  But it has always been true and always will be: you get what you pay for.Good luck!"

Initially, it worked just fine. Running fairly smooth and could handle every app I needed. But more recently, especially in the last month, it has had a tendency to glitch out. Often to the point of rendering the phone useless. Specifically, it will vibrate sporadically and close whatever app I was using. Then it wont even take another input leaving my with a brick showing my home screen. before, merely locking the phone, waiting a moment, and trying again would work to regain usability after a couple tries, but now it will persist to have this issue after up to an hour of fighting it. Even simple actions such as receiving a call become literally impossible. I must say I am disappointed in this phone."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",6-May-17,1,A TERRIBLE Phone!,"I have to say, this phone I've been using for 4 months and it is absolutely terrible! My phone randomly restarts, one time it randomly restarted 5 times in a row. The screen becomes unresponsive and doesn't work. When I'm typing, it freezes and sometimes when I tap on something, the phone taps on something else after a couple seconds. The phone sometimes has a mind of its own. I hate it! But, the phone is only $150. What could I expect for a $150 ""smartphone"". On my phone, the Bluetooth chip must not be a very good chip. My Bluetooth turns off at any given time, I have to manually turn it back on and sometimes turns back off. I turn it back on, the phone turns it back off. I contacted Blu and they told me to reset my phone, I did so and it still does the same thing. I wouldn't recommend this phone even if this was the last phone on the planet!"

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",21-Jan-18,3,Last update broke my phone. This may help someone if you're having audio issues after the update to 7.0,"This is the second time I have purchased this phone due to it being lost. I liked the first one so much that I purchased it again.Now for the real reason for this review: After the update yesterday to 7.0 I lost all call audio. I couldn't hear anything anyone said when making or receiving calls. This condition also effected blue tooth calling and the speaker phone feature. After a reset the device began working again so I loaded the usual apps and set it up the way I normally would and then it started acting up again. I then reset it again and paid attention to the issue after each application install and every change I had made to it. I figured out that the problem only occurred when I had the voice activated ""OK Google"" feature activated. So if you're having this issue deactivate the voice activated ""OK Google"" feature.Google account/settings/voice/voice match, and turn off: Say ""Ok Google"" any time.I hope this helps someone out and keeps them from pulling their hair out trying to figure out what's going on."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",2-Oct-17,1,Takes 8 hours or more to charge/screen shatters easily.,"I bought this phone to replace my old Blu vivo selfie. I loved that phone and have used blu for about 3 years now. I am having issues with this phone and I have literally had it in my hand for less than a month. I ordered it on 9/1/2017 and took it out of the package on 9/5/2017. It takes about 8-10 hours to fully charge which is the absolute worst feature about it. When I read the specs I expected it to do as it said it would and charge fully within 2.5 hours. The camera is also very shakey. You must keep your hand absolutely still for a few seconds before the image is fully taken on the device or it comes out blurry. The charging issue needs to be resolved.UPDATE:I have had this phone since September 2017, today is Feb 6th 2018. The phone is constantly freezing and it won't hold a charge longer than a few hours. Unfortunately you cannot replace the battery either. Still having charging issues except now in 8- 10 hours the phone only charges between 20-65% these phones definitely aren't built like they used to be. I dont recommend this phone."

I opened a ticket with BLU and they sent me instructions on how to completely reset the phone wiping out all data.The funny thing is I bought my daughter a new BLU phone a month after mine and she received a bad software update from BLU that had issues and required a patch to restore the phone (and even after the very manual patch workaround, her phone is still not working as it should be post patch!).Clearly quality control has gone the wayside over at BLU, I would recommend you stay away from this brand from this point forward."

Started working fine but around June/July both phones started giving us the same problem.  Apps will close on their own, screen freezes, sometimes screen is unresponsive. I have contacted BLU and  they initiated a warranty claim.  I am sending both phones back to BLU and according to them it takes between 10 to 20 days for them to receive them.  I'm not sure for how long I will be without a phone.  I had other BLU phones in the past and never had issues like this one.  Another thing is that this phone is not NFC capable (big let down).  I will update my review after I receive my phones back from BLU. I've seen in other reviews that they got their phones back just to keep having the same issues.  More to follow."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",21-Mar-18,2,Disappointing,"I've been a BLU customer for a while now, and decided to take the plunge with the Vivo XL2. Usually when I buy BLU, I'll find a happy medium of the lowest price combined with the most features available, and get away with a new phone for under $90. This time I decided to spend the few extra dollars, and get something that I had hoped would be a really nice phone, and not just a bare-minimum to get me through another year.  At first, I was really happy with the phone. The touch screen response time an app load times were short and crisp, the screen is bright and large, and overall, when the phone works, it does work really well.However, I didn't even get the chance to drop the phone a couple of times before it started developing a personality. Ever since I first got the phone, it has had a weird quirk where when I'm making a phone call, I can only hear the person on the other end about 20% of the time or less. There isn't any consistency as to when it happens, it's really just hit or miss. Again, I still have yet to actually drop my phone (and I have the BLU-version of an OtterBox case on this phone for when I do) so this issue isn't because of anything I have done since receiving the phone. It has the same problem after connecting/disconnecting Bluetooth headsets; however I've noticed that I'm more likely to hear the call if I use a Bluetooth headset than if I use the handset earpiece.Also, the battery life on this phone is rather disappointing. I wouldn't even bother mentioning it, but BLU felt that it was a selling point and brought up the ""huge"" battery this phone had in the ad on Amazon. All in all the battery works as you would expect, but don't expect to be going multiple days without having to charge up.Overall, I'm surprised that I've had less problems with the BLU phones that cost half as much as this one. Hoping that this isn't a theme, and will be sending in this phone for a replacement/repair as the issues aren't getting better."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",14-May-17,2,9 Months of Daily Use: The Trip Report,"Multitasking has yet to present an issue and this phone has comfortably handled everything I've thrown at it. Even comes with some nice value-added stuff I wasn't expecting (pre-installed screen protector, TPU case, earbuds, IR blaster). Some marks against it:-Don't really care for the UI or a lot of the on-board apps; many of these are installed at the system level and can't even be disabled, either. Stock Android is fine and I sincerely don't understand why manufacturers have such a stick up their ass about actually sticking to it; BLU could definitely do much better here.-This phone will take decent photos under most circumstances, but trying to take panoramic photos on this thing is an almost Sisyphean task at times; ANYTHING that forces the camera to re-focus will totally break the photo and you'll have to start from scratch.-Nine months into use in December, this phone has started to develop a nasty habit of ""ghost-pressing"" the back button a bunch on its own and completely unprompted, kicking you out of apps and vibrating incessantly all the while. I've apparently been lucky with mine, as this has been an oft-reported issue at least since July. I'm not sure what causes it, but considering I've never dropped this phone or exposed it to any extreme conditions, this can't speak favorably to its build quality.-I don't know if it's the included earbuds or the headphone jack, but it is notoriously difficult to consistently get this phone to pump audio through the earbuds; audio often cuts out, pipes out of the phone speakers at an obnoxious volume, etc.This phone was a steal at the time of purchase, but now I understand why, and I don't totally feel comfortable recommending it for daily use. Look elsewhere unless you just can't find something else with comparable hardware at this price point."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",10-Mar-17,5,Kiki's Bad Hair Day....🐕Update review,"Update : April 5 2017Okay so I've had the phone for a while now. And I think I can actually give a decent insightful review.I have a friend who has the Samsung Galaxy S7edge, and he likes my blu Vivo xl 2 better. I have not performed a speed test but in everyday use my phone accomplishes every task I throw at it. I am a very heavy user, I'm on my phone for most of the day. So far I am very pleased with the phone. I just got a update to the Google assistant..... Yea. I will never pay for a Carrier branded smartphone again. I use T-Mobile as my phone service provider and the signal strength is excellent. The only thing I have missed about my T-Mobile flagship phone is WiFi calling, so I downloaded Google hangout as a alternative to the T-Mobile baked in version, not quite as good but acceptable. I have used the cameras on this phone a lot, in different lighting and subjects and I find the performance to be quite good. I think that a lot of the quality of the photos taken has to do with the photographers ability. The pictures my friend gets on his S7edge are not as good as the ones I have taken with my Blu vivo xl2.All in all I like this phone very much.I have uploaded more pictures for your review.I will add to this review at a later date.I mainly wanted to illustrate the capability of the main camera. The photo I am including in this review is a picture of our little dog Kiki on a bad  hair day..... lol 😁This was taken in poor lighting with a moving subject. All editing has been accomplished with the camera software that came preloaded."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",15-Nov-17,4,Nice phone for the money,working well so far like the bigger screen and the additional memory makes a difference
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",12-Jun-17,5,Five Stars,No problems nor issues
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",7-Mar-17,3,"Yes, but not for the NON-tech-savvy","After just three days I am very pleased with the BLU Vivo XL2. But it took a bit to get to this place: out of the box I hated the custom interface -- I agree with those who described it as ""heavy"". Fortunately I read the Amazon reviewers who recommended replacing it with Nova Launcher, which I did, and then customized it to my liking. Now it is a beauty.The major issue has been using an SD card. I wanted this BLU for my media: audiobooks, podcasts, epubs, video and some music. I have been using Android since 2.3. Never have I had so much trouble working with an SD card. First, there are no instructions (anywhere that I could find) for working with SD cards. This is the first phone I have had with a SIM/SD drawer. There are two slots (of different sizes) in the drawer. Thank goodness another reviewer alerted me to placing the SD card in  SIM slot #1. This may seem dumb, but I was not careful when I popped the drawer out and did not notice the orientation. So when I placed SIM and SD card in the drawer the first time I had the phone display side up. This was a big mistake: when I pushed the drawer in it stuck. Obviously the wrong side, and I had to use tweezers to pry the drawer out, which was not easy. Why was this not in the quick start guide? -- to re-insert the SIM/SD drawer, the phone MUST BE DISPLAY SIDE DOWN.Secondly, since there is no information about how to use the SD card with this model I did what I have done with the Androids I have owned in the last decade or so: I allowed the Android system to format the card to its liking. After formatting, the file explorers in the Android OS or my PC (using USB cable) did not recognize the card -- no trace of it. I do not recall all of the steps I took to fix the problem (I suspected the card was not mounted, a problem I have not had with Android), but before I did I contacted BLU customer service. Other than the lack of information about using an SD card on this machine, the dull-witted BLU CS is the other reason the Vivo XL2 gets 3/5. I explained the problem to them as I have here; their response had nothing to do with this phone. I fixed the issue on my own and now my SD card is recognized and loaded with my content.For whatever reason, BLU loves the paint on this machine (the battery cover). I expected to be wowed, but no: it looks better on the computer photos. I now wish I bought the gold rather than the midnight blue.I cannot tell that the battery charges any faster than the Galaxy S3s and S4 I have used for years, but the description claimed some sort of quick charge. The battery does not seem special.BLU includes a (relatively hard) case in the package, which is nice. I usually prefer more rubbery silicone, but this one allows the phone to slip in and out of the pocket easily Unfortunately, it does not protrude over the screen and protect it. Also, the corners slip off the phone easily. I may prefer the gummy case I had for another phone, which fits better than the one made for it (the slots do not match).During baseball season I watch each of my team's games on my phone. I have not had a chance yet on this one, nor have i watched high quality video yet. But at this point I am quite pleased with the screen. I love the 5.5 inch size.I thought I might like having the power and volume on the same side of the phone, but so far I do not because it is more difficult to pick the phone up without pressing the power button.I read some reviewers comment that BLU phones do not last. Right now I am happy with the Vivo XL2, but I want it to last for years rather than a year.I would recommend it, but I worry about folks who are not tech-savvy using this phone."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Mar-17,5,Five Stars,Really great phone
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",4-Oct-17,4,"Won't Razzle-Dazzle, but a Good, Solid Smartphone and a Great Value","I've had my Vivo XL2 for two months now. So far, everything working about how I expected.My wife and I have had several Blu phones in the past. 2 of the 3 were fantastic (my Studio 6 and my wife's Energy 2), one was a bit of a dog (my Studio 5+5).So far I've been happy with my XL2. It's clearly not a top-of-the-line smartphone, but it's more than enough for what I use it for---phone and texting, taking photo snapshots, watching the occasional Netflix or Amazon Prime video, and Kindle. There's nothing particularly great about it that makes it stand out, but everything is solid---decent looking screen, responsiveness and speed, accurate touch for onscreen interactions. My main gripe with the Blu Studio 5+5 was that the on-screen touch detection was BEYOND AWFUL; I'm happy to report that the Vivo XL2 does not have this problem at all, touch detection is very good.Probably the worst part of the phone is the battery life. It's merely average; I can go a couple of days of minimal use before needing to charge it. So, nothing all that bad, but nothing to brag about either.All in all, this is an incredibly solid smartphone for a very good price, and is easily all the ""smartphone"" non-gamers would need. It's not the sexiest thing out there, but I've been highly satisfied with my purchase."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Jan-17,4,BLU VIVO XL 2 vs ZTE ZMAX 2,"So this seems like the first real review from someone who actually owns the phone.Just got it in the mail yesterday. This was suppose to be the Gionee P7 Max rebranded by BLU. The back isn't as shiny as Gionee so looks like BLU did a good job recasting it with their logo. This seems a lot heavier than my previous smartphone (ZTE Zmax 2) but I needed an upgrade from my 16gb internal storage and 2gb ram. VIVO XL 2 offers 32gb internal storage and 3gb ram but it definitely doesn't feel any faster than the Zmax 2. In fact, in some cases, it feels like it lags behind Zmax 2 when I only have one or two apps opened. Which I found it to be strange.Even though their width and height are quite similar (VIVO XL 2 being slightly wider), I found the Zmax 2 and its buttons a lot easier to hold and use with one or both hands. For some reason the VIVO XL 2 seems like it's almost jabbing the side of my palm when being held. I don't find it comfortable and the buttons on it are rather slimer than the Zmax 2 and while you would think that might be a plus, taking screenshots (holding lower volume+power button) and volume control is somewhat of an unnecessary hassle.Also the back finish on Zmax 2 really helps you secure having a grip on your phone whereas it's easier for VIVO XL 2 to slip in between your fingers and fall.The login screen that asks for your pattern or password for VIVO XL 2 is awkwardly place towards the top of your screen (whereas Zmax 2 place it at the bottom of your screen) - which makes it difficult to unlock it with just one hand.One good thing about VIVO XL 2 is its 13MP / 8 MP camera. While it's nothing extraordinary, it does seem to take clearer picture than the Zmax 2. The VIVO XL 2 also comes with Android Marshmallow, whereas Zmax 2 is upgradeable to that, it's installed with Lollipop.As for the accessories, all of them are WHITE. Which is a key giveaway BLU was too lazy to source their accessories to match their phone colors (since VIVO XL 2 only comes in blue and gold). It's a USB charger so it does take longer to charge your phone back up in compare to Zmax 2. Package wise, it was a lot nicer than what I expected for a phone in this price range. The phone built is pretty much what you would expect in this price range but from afar, it doesn't look cheap (if you purchased the blue version).BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a 32gb internal storage and 3gb of RAM with decent camera on a budget, VIVO XL 2 might be for you. If you already have a phone with 2gb of RAM, that +1gb of RAM isn't going to give you any fairytale endings."

Why would I buy another Blu phone when this one is annoying me with spam. Blu would have a better chance of selling me another one if they didn't make me regret getting this one. Mine didn't come with the ""super special"" sunburst back that Blu touts so hard for this phone or the box I've seen in unboxing reviews. Made me wonder if its real. The phone has more native memory than the Advance 5.0 it replaced and that's all I wanted anyway. I found it responds better without the screen protector. Other than that it's just a phone. I can live with it for now. I had to send the first one back due to sketchy touchscreen. My last Blu, tho."

I feel let down. I can't return the phone since the 30 days are done. It was a waste of money now I'm currently saving to buy a replacement... Not satisfied at all...

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",8-Jan-18,3,Hit or miss on it working properly.,"Phone worked great for the first six months. Then the front buttons started acting up. The phone would act like the home button was pressed (and sometimes held so that the Google Assistant would be enabled). You wouldn't be able to do anything else on the screen until this glitch stopped. You also couldn't press any of the other buttons on the front. I would have to shut off the screen, wait a moment and then go back to what I was doing on the phone.I contacted Blu, who had me send it in at my expense, and then they ""fixed"" it (they wouldn't tell me what they did to the phone). Now, two months after that, the phone started exhibiting the same issues again. My wife has the same phone, purchased just a few months after I initially bought this one, and hers is working fine.Outside of this issue, they phone works great. Plenty of storage for apps, music, etc. Great amount of RAM for apps to run and not be sluggish. Speaker volume on pretty much any BLU phone is always low, so wasn't surprised that this phone was the same."

Loved the extra memory for the price. 6 months down the road, my apps started freezing then the battery went crazy from 80% to 30% in a matter of seconds, then it wouldn't charge. I called Blu and I had to send them my cell and pay for the shipping. Luckily I saved my previous cell otherwise I'd be without a phone. I mailed it on a Friday, they received it on the following Wednesday and they shipped it back 2 days later and I received it on Tuesday 7 business days later. Not bad. The phone arrived with no invoice or what they fixed. No email either explaining other than they shipped my cell back to me. I called and was told they changed out the battery. 11 days later again the battery won't charge now. So as I write this review I'm getting ready to call them again. Save your money and buy a Samsung. My Samsung prime is still kicking after a few years. It just didn't have enough memory. Update- so I just called Blu customer service. Told them my cell won't charge or turn on after trying 3 different chargers which included the Blu charger that came with the phone originally. So now they put in a request to replace my cell. They are emailing me a return label so I don't have to pay shipping again, which I appreciate. They will be sending me a new cell not a refurbished one per the csr. So I'm satisfied so far."

I got it today, put my AT&T sim in, logged into my Google account and transferred everything to this one.  So far calls have been good and clear.  Picture quality I'm happy with.  Screen size is great,  I'm coming from a Galaxy SIII.  Phone is more responsive than my last one.  I do wish it had an octa core processor, but for the price, and 3 gig of ram I jumped on it.  We shall see how I feel in a month, but for now I'm happy.Update: 2/26/17I'm still please with the phone part, but from some reason I cannot get my Samsung HBS910 to connect to use for phone calls via bluetooth.Until this is fixed knocking off 2 stars."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",30-Nov-17,2,This is a nice phone. The function of it is a bit ...,"This is a nice phone. The function of it is a bit different than any Samsung or LG phone that I've had so it takes some getting used to.I've had it for over 2 months now, and about half my calls are going straight to voicemail. At first all my calls were going straight to voicemail.I use MetroPCS. And I have tried troubleshooting by service carrier and also by hardware manufacturer.No one seems to be able to help me permanently resolve this issue. BLU will warranty it,  but in order to do that I will need to mail my phone to them first, which leaves me without a phone for up to 15 days which to me is not acceptable.I'll have continue to try to troubleshoot is or buy another phone. And I think the latter would be a better option.But I don't believe I'll be going BLU again."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",24-May-17,3,Works well for a few months,"When I first got the phone it worked perfectly.. however, I have not gotten it wet, have not dropped it and it appears to be in perfect condition... I've had it less than a year and now it randomly vibrates and exits out of anything I have open then just keeps vibrating. I have to turn it off and back on every time.. I think when I go to buy another phone which will probably be soon I definitely would not purchase this brand again."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",9-May-17,3,"Good Device, but...","First of all, let me just start off by saying this is a really nice phone. The design is great, although very prone to fingerprint smudges. DO NOT GET FOOLED BY THE 3GB of RAM. You only get to use abut 1-2. When I have received 3GB RAM devices outside of BLU, 2.96-2.85 GB of RAM was available for the user to use. Horrible memory management on this phone, but it actually still runs smoothly. Also, this phone is missing quite a few important LTE bands, so it's not fully LTE although you will get good speeds in some places. Overall, I'd say this phone has a pretty elegant design, feels great in the hand, screen quality is spot on and nice, etc. Nothing other than RAM and LTE coverage to complain about. Improve those two and this is honestly one of the best devices I've used. Outside of the RAM, there is no difference between this and an iPhone 6+ (that's noticeable). Camera quality... I've seen better for the price or but it's still pretty good in good lighting!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-Mar-17,4,Four Stars,I was seriously impressed This phone is a great value for the money
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-Nov-17,2,Really enjoyed this phone for the first couple of months,"Really enjoyed this phone for the first couple of months. Looks great, wasn't sluggish at all. But a couple of months in and my touchscreen glitches to the point where this is unusable. I'd be using my phone and the touchscreen will rapidly start pressing buttons I didn't touch. Shutting it off and turning it back on doesn't solve the issue and it has only increased in frequency. The only thing I can do is put the phone down and let it run its course until I can start using it again."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",22-Feb-17,4,"My favorite so far, BUT........","Sooo,  This would be my most favorite Blu phone(out of 5) ever, got it on a lightning  deal for 99.00, but.....There is an issue with notification/ringtones not giving a sample sound when you select one.  To test it you have to have someone call or text you.  Blu would not acknowledge this in 3 complaints through amazon so I started a return and received a second phone, same problem, and returned that one.  4th time they said there is a software problem and they are working on it.I have had an issue with my call blocker app not functioning properly.My advise is whenever buying a phone for 100-150 expect some glitches.  For the money I think they are great. My Life XL functions great but it only has 16gb memory.  This phone has a great 32gb and accepted my 64gb sd card no problem  Fantastic.  If I can get this problem fixed, I would keep this phone for a long time.  If this problem does not get fixed, I will return this one, and go back to the life XL.I also previously complained on the lock screen  and lack of an app button to show all your apps of a previous model. That was not answered, but have found with this model it is their ""carefree"" launcher.  I switched to Nova launcher and am happy with that."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",9-May-17,4,Definitely a good phone for only $150,"I've had this phone about a week and am pretty pleased so far.LIKES:--comes with Marshmallow--camera seems pretty good, includes native editing software--processing speed is fast--start screen is super handyDISLIKES:--battery life is not as long as I had hoped, still have to charge once a day--size is almost too big for my little hands (but I guess this would be a 'like' to some people)--the default launcher lacks the app drawer, I had to find a third party launcher to install"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-Mar-17,5,Five Stars,Works excellent.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",7-Mar-17,2,Premium Phone for $150??!!! How?!,"UPDATE: I had to return the original because it kept freezing and refusing to turn on and randomly restarting.  Now I have the replacement and it's doing the same thing!!!!!  I think there may some issue with the firmware when a smartwatch is connected over Bluetooth and a WiFi network is connected.  If you disable any of those things the phone works fine.  Beware those of you who intend to connect a smartwatch.Nobody needs to spend $400-$800 on a smartphone any more.  This is a NO COMPROMISE $150 phone.  Show me someone who needs more features and power than this phone has and I will show you a darn liar.  Not only does it have a terrific 5.5"" size screen with a curvature to the gorilla glass 3, but it has an IR blaster to control your home A/V system, great 4G and Wifi radios with crystal clear audio on both ends, and the battery lasts and lasts! Looks and feels like an expensive phone too.  Amazing value and it's American made too?  What more could you possibly ask for.  Great stuff BLU keep up the good work.  If Nougat gets rolled out on it, I might just soil myself."

It's light, fits well in my petite hands, audio sound while listen to music with speaker is good, talking on phone is clear and my other party says no background noise and comes out clear on their end. I would have like that the description/specification for this phone had the following: standard sim card is advise if you use the nano sim card slot.  Because if you have a nano sim card, you cannot use the mircoSD. I am awaiting to for the adapter kit to arrive so that I can use both slots."

If i use 2 sim card i can't use the memory card. I want to be able to use the 2 sim cards and the memory card at the same time like with the other Blu phones I have used.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",10-Jan-18,1,Quit charging in less than 3 months.  Don't waste your money.,"Nice looking phone, but after 3 months of use, it no longer charges.  I have a Moto G4 phone which cost the same that works great.  This one will be replaced with another one of those.  Very disappointed in this phone.Update:  Received an RMA to return this phone for warranty repair.  Except the USPS says there is no such address or company.  Now I'm reporting them to Amazon and my credit card company."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",5-Apr-17,5,"I've got the ""BLU's""","I recently bought the Blu R1 HD Amazon promo phone and was blown away by the functionality.  It was a big step up from what I had been using (tracfone models) and I planned on keeping it for a good while.  Well, I managed to break the camera lens and figured I'd order another- guess what, Amazon won't sell you two of the promo phones.  I looked at the various Blu offerings and settled on the Vivo XL2.  Maybe I'm just easy to please, but I love this thing.  32 GB, great camera, and what I think is the sweet spot on phone size- not too small, not too big.  Great display, and they throw in a case. 2 screen protectors (one already on) and a good quality set of earbuds.  I took the advice of another reviewer and put a 128 GB sd card in and it works fine.  I guess the only complaint is the ""dual"" sim card aspect.  It's not a dual if you want to use an sd card, it will only accept one."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",5-Sep-17,1,After update apps disappeared and wiped the SD card,"After the latest update many of my apps disappeared as well as everything on my SD card. Not a happy customer, returning the phone."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",7-Apr-17,5,Great Phone for the price!!!,Great phone for the money. Takes great pics and is really fast. 4gLTE compatible. Takes 2 small Sims or 1 sim and 1 memory card. Completely sealed back. Sim and memory card goes in the side. Simply a wonderful phone.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",24-Jan-18,2,Terrible for long term use,The first few months of having this phone were great but a few months in I started getting ads and now only 7 months after having this phone it glitches constantly and the battery dies incredibly quickly with the new updates. Buyers beware!
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",13-Feb-17,5,Sweet deal... Pay less and get more,Wow Sweet deal it's like a note 4 and better... I can even change my TV with this phone... Great price great phone. Good job Blu on this new vivo xl2... Keep up the good work

That problem started to appear when I used it for one month."

Data connection drops off at random times and ...,Have been using this phone with Tmobile for a few months now and data connection is iffy at best.  Data connection drops off at random times and in random places.  Dont know if its something wrong with my phone or its just BLU phones in general.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Mar-17,5,Blu Vivo X2 - a winner!,This is a great phone by BLU. I upgraded from the Blu H1 RD and there's a vast difference in performance. The build quality is very good and the casing has a substantial feel to it. The included Blu software is not as intuitive as one would like and I've had to revert to Google launcher to provide a near stock Android experience. You can't use both simcards with an SD card at the same time.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-Jun-17,1,Do not buy,Probably one of the worst phones I have ever bought and as far as battery life would have a completely full battery in the morning after being charged all night. And within 2 hours it is completely dead and require more charge.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Aug-17,1,Worst phone ever,This is the least user friendly phone that I have ever had. From the easily cracked screen to having to download an app just to make and receive class is too much. Don't care what Apple does. Phones are portable so the are more likely to be dropped. Not a good value if you group your phone and it shatters....let me guess? you need need to buy a screen protector .  Bull. Had a phone for years with no case or screen protector and would drop all the time. No cracked s reenact or phone. . Good luck finding or wanting to remove the battery. Not user friendly at all. First and last time buying one....and you Amazon can kick rocks for reccommending this crap.

I have been using this phone for about 6 months and it is falling apart.  I did purchase there 2 year extra warranty, they just do not have a local place (anywhere in the us) to bring your phone in for a repair.  You must mail your phone in.  So. If you are like me, you depend on your phone to communicate with work, family and friends.  It just might be worth it to buy a different phone, maybe from a company starting with the letter A that have authorized and non authorized repair shops to get your device fixed anywhere?"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",10-Sep-17,1,This phone is terrible,This is the worst phone I've ever had. I've had it only a few days and it constantly freezes.  It is currently stuck on the Blu screen and will not budge.  I had two other Blu phones which I really liked but this one is garbage. I intend to return it.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",29-Nov-17,3,beautiful pictures and video,"It is okay, beautiful pictures and video. The only problem I have with it is after the update, I have not been able to have access to my phone since yesterday. The phone keeps asking for a password which I do not know.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",30-Jul-17,3,enough to do the job but has just enough software bugs to be annoying. I go through sunglasses,"ya get what you pay for. The phone is adequate,  enough to do the job but has just enough software bugs to be annoying.  I go through sunglasses, watches and phones fast.  If you are like me and tired of paying a lot of money for phones give it a try.  But you wont see a lot of software updates from BLU so, if you don't plan to buy and hold, give it a try.  I'm sure I will break, burn, crush, crack or dunk this one soon and when I do I will buy again."

I have gone through two of these phones now and they have both had problems.  The first one stopped charging after a month and then the second had bugs from the beginning then I try to go and return it and they charged me for a restocking fee.  Not happy at all and would give negative stars if I could.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!

BLU customer support just suggested a hard reset, then clearing the cache for the apps, but the whole thing seems funky. It's gotta go. Too bad, I wanted it to be good!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",30-Sep-17,2,"Performance is not the best, I understand it is a cheap phone but ...","Performance is not the best, I understand it is a cheap phone but the problems are more than they should be. It randomly takes screen shots and turns on in my pocket, or while charging. Apps don't respond at a normal pace compared to other phones in the same price range. It surfs the internet okay(when it doesn't lock up) and connects into my network the way it should. For what it is it's okay, but I think money could be better spent on a larger named device."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",31-Jan-18,2,Decent phone to start but rapidly went downhill,"The first impressions of the phone are great but, time is not on your side. It's been 9 months and the battery has already degraded. When using a high demand app I can watch the battery bar tick down every few seconds.It has frozen up, glitched out and slowed down to crawl and the past few months. The worst part is the adware that suddenly started downloading apps on it's own. After a system update I woke up to three new apps installed. I removed them but I fear the main cause cannot be removed without rooting. I no longer believe my information is secure and I'm getting a new non Blu phone pronto.TLDR: Cheap phone, won't last a year, and time brings adware & glitches"

This phone does not have the app draw. But it's great in every other way. Takes amazing pictures for the phone to had cost so little. Does a whole lot more for the small amount I paid.

I need to contact Customer Support to see if this can be resolved without returning the phone.I have been in touch with Customer Support and they had me reset the phone to the Factory Default.  It looked promising at first but when I started using the phone again the problem came back, unfortunately.  I will have to contact them again to see what can be done."

My previous daily driver was the Blu XL  which was fine except 16G/2G was just not enough.  At this price for a 32G/3G phone I couldn't resist upgrading. Everything about this phone is great so buy it with no fears or concerns. The camera, the screen, the speed, the storage are all top notch. I don't even think I will ever need to use the SD card slot as 32G is ample space for my needs. One very impressive thing I must say is that my reception using this phone is greatly improved at work where nobody gets service - With this phone I have decent service from ATT. It's like this phone is more receptive than my other phones? My phone rang all day long which for me at work has never happened - I used to just get notifications of missed calls and voicemails on my drive home."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",22-May-17,5,Android for the 99%,"The move backwards in USB connectors made sense - the only reason I needed this phone was  the USB C port on the XL would no longer stay connected/constantly charging.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Jul-17,2,Four months in.,Seems like a nice phone but after about three months the Bluetooth stopped working and then shortly after it started turning off when you put it on the charger. Now it just won't charge above 60%. I don't know if this a fluke or it's a common issue. I will say that I haven't dropped it and there isn't any physical damage and I've only used the charger it came with.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",27-Feb-17,3,Good phone for the price! Message Access Profile is NON-EXISTENT on this device.,"I really like the feel of the phone, and the speed at which it handles application (thanks to the 3GB of RAM). The instructions (which are printed very small) really needs clarification on SD card and SIM card usage. In order to use a SD card, you must put it in the SIM 1 slot, and the SIM card will sit in the SIM 2 slot.  Another annoyance is that the phone does not have the Message Access Profile (MAP) that is needed when syncing with my car (Ford Flex w/ Sync 3). Phone will sync, but messages will not connect to car, due to the missing MAP file. My prior BLU Studio phone had this feature and it worked flawlessly."

I the fact the phone came with a screen putector and case was awsome. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a budget friendly option that wants all the features of name brand Android but not the price tag of one. I saw a review of how uncomfortable it was for them to hold in hand but that's truly false. I have rather small hands and its comfortable for me.

Very slick but I previously owned the Blu Vivo XL and just expected a lot more.  The biggest improvement is in the backing.  The old version was cheap plastic and broke easily.  This model was definitely stronger.  What I didn't like is that it says the speed of charging is improved and I found it incredibly slow.  If not using the Blu branded charger, it literally didn't fully charge when left plugged in overnight.  With the Blu charger it took 3 hours.  Hugely disappointed considering that was a big selling point.  There is also some software that is not removable that kept coming up as malware.  You couldn't even disable it.  I'm big on security and this scared me a bit.  Finally it was quite a bit slower than the old model in my experience.  I will be returning today."

They don't support this phone even, and that is why the site doesn't recognize what phone it is.They had to email instructions for me to type in, because if I opened up the settings, the phone disconnected.Now today it list all the information I typed in from the instructions, and so it opens things so slow, that the computer I had in 1994 with a 2400 baud modem was faster.I have had it less than a week and have already tested out it's flight capabilities after days of utter aggravation and frustration!!!I had to spend 20 minutes just getting to this review site."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Aug-17,2,quality seems to be doing down while the price is going up,"I have had blue products for years now.  They have been such good values that I could buy one a year.  I have bought 5 at this point.  I noticed with the last 2 that the quality has gone down but the price has gone up.  They are very glitchy.  The one I had before this, which I only had a bit over a month, would not ring if the person wasn't already in my phone and it kept changing the ringtones of the people in my phone. This one has never allowed me to change the original texting ringtone.  Occasionally the regular phone ringtone will turn into an actual telephone type ringtone.  Now, the most annoying thing at all is that it is suffering from phantom touching where the phone will vibrate and go in and out of apps on it's own.  I understand what this is because it happened on my Ipad and I looked it up."

I have researched BLU products for well over 6 months and fell in love with their sleek design.  This phone has been amazing. It came in yesterday. I put all of my apps on it and I still have a ton of space. Also, it is thin and sleek.  I love the gold color. I wish it had more case options. It is so new (released Jan 2017) that there aren't many (none) cases available.  But, that does not matter. The phone itself is great.  It came with chargers, a case (not a big deal case, but it is good for now), screen protector, earbuds, connector cord for other media.  It is great.  The phone is fast. The camera's are great.  I am just very pleased.UPDATE:  Although I am still very pleased with the phone itself, I am disappointed with the lack of accessories. The case that was provided with the phone was not substantial enough.  I contacted BLU customer service about phone cases; I was was told that I needed to contact BluPhoneParts.com; however, when I called them, they said that they do not provide cases nor are they affiliated with the company. Their website does not offer ANY products for VIVO XL2. VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Mar-17,1,This smartphone is a disappointment,"UPDATED REVIEW:After seven months of having this phone, the battery ended bulding up and completely breaking the phone.The battery life was not the best ever since I brought it, but after about four months of use it started to go straight downhill in its performance eventhought I always used the charger that came with it.Long story short: Ended up with a bulged up battery that cannot be replaced because it is non-removable and thus, with a useless phone.I deeply regret this purchase.OLD REVIEW:I purchased this item a little more than a month ago. Before it, I used to own the original Vivo XL (item that I absolutely loved, its performance almost flawless during the whole year I owned it -just had a little problem with the app Snapchat- But it had a great value for its price) that I sadly ended up breaking in an accident.While looking for replacement I found out, to my huge excitement that the VIVO XL2 had been released just a moth before, and to the same price than its predecessor. I was torn, trying to decide which one to acquire but, considering the great item the VIVO XL proved to be and after checking out this phone's specs, I did not hesitate and chose this one, expecting an upgrade from my previous one.However, this cellphone proved me terribly wrong. It fails on many aspects the original did not.•Its screen in incredibly sensitive, to the extent that it reacts even the touch of the earphone's wire -it's not a nice thing to be listening to music or watching a video and having it closed or changed by your own earphones-.•Both cameras are absolutely bad, they claim them to be of 8 and 13MP just like in the original, and yet their performance is by far worst even if made to snaps pics in their supposed best quality. The primary one keeps blurring out the photos and, when it does not they seem granulated and rough, lacking color and brightness. The secondary one only takes decent pictures when outside under direct sunlight, if the photo is snapped indoors -where lighting is usually a bit lesser- they turn out blurred and undefined. Problems I did NOT have with the VIVO XL which photographies were clear and vivid (a little too sharp while in the camera screen, maybe, but nothing too dramatic).•The apps continuously freeze and crash.•But, by far, the BATTERY LIFE is absolutely the worst this Smartphone has to offer compared to the original one. While I could have my VIVO XL running continuously -with a normal app use- for almost two days straight after a single charge, this one does not last more than maybe 12 hours, when I'm being careful not to open too many apps. Such is the bad performance it has in this department that many times, the minute after -literally- the battery level reaches 15% the counter will go down incredibly fast and the cellphone will shut down. Such thing only happened to me with a very bad performing Samsung I used to have some years ago, because yes, you guessed it, this did NOT happen to my original VIVO XL which I many times kept ""alive"" for hours with less than 8% because it had an OUTSTANDING performance. This is not an exaggeration.Also, less points to this model because the battery is not removable, which leaves you unable to forcefully turn it off if it eventually freezes -thing that I'm sure will happen to me at some point soon due to this device poor performance-.So, in resume, if you are planning to buy this item I HIGHLY recommend you reconsider it and purchase the original VIVO XL instead. That Smartphone is by far much better than this supposed upgrade.I ended up regretting greatly having bought this one alternatively, because I ended up getting me a very disappointing downgrade. I have nothing good to say about his cellphone because it practically did not improve its performance compared to the previous one."

Maybe a nice rubberized case would prevent that from happening, so perhaps not a deal breaker. On the other hand, the battery drainage is crazy. I used it a few moments last night after a full charge, then put it to sleep. Now there is about 30% of battery life left. I used my Honor 5x for a much more extended amount of time last night, then put it to rest, too. At this moment, it still has an 80% charge.I thought 3g RAM and 32g Memory would mean a faster device. Not so. My Honor (2g Ram/16g Memory) matches every inch of speed.The sound on calls is very ""tinny"". Ringtone and notification alerts are muted so that you can not hear them if you're more than 10 or 20 feet away from the phone. Very little sound comes out of the device.Ultimately, if you want a device that makes your hands uncomfortable, has no battery life, isn't any speedier than lower rank smartphones and has no volume, this is the phone for you.AMAZON! PEOPLE! SOMEBODY!!!! Please advise me on the return policy for this phone. I don't want it. I don't like it. And I SINCERELY want to return it without penalties."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",17-Jun-17,5,This is an excellent phone for the price,"This is an excellent phone for the price. Ive been using if for a few weeks and have had no problems at all. I find it very comparable to my Samsung in ease of use. This phone definitely gives you a quality feel, look and capabiity for less. Honestly the only tiny thing you might get from spending hundreds more on a Samsung or Iphone is better picture quality. However I still feel this takes excellent pictures and videos and the battery life can't be beat. Definitely recommend!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-Sep-17,1,Don't buy this phone!,"Wouldn't connect to wi-fi, among other problems. If I could give less than 1 star, I would. Their tech support was a complete joke. When I brought it to my cell phone store, they said they couldn't help since my problems were known problems with the phone. I had to return it...which I thankfully could through Amazon."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Jan-17,5,IGNORE REVIEWS FOR THIS PHONE!,"I don't own this phone yet, neither does anyone else that has reviewed here as of 1/25.  But since others are using reviews to trash BLU phones in general (with no intentions of ever purchasing one) I find it fair to defend them.  We own two Vivo XL and they are fantastic phones. I can only imagine the XL2 to be that much better.  My one knock MIGHT be that I think it is going to have Micro USB instead of the USB C on the original XL which will be disheartening since USB C is so superior in so many ways.I will update this review WHEN I ACTUALLY GET THE PHONE.  For now, I would ignore any reviews you read here for at least a few weeks."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Jan-17,5,I would also like to defend BLU phones,"I would also like to defend BLU phones. I work as a river guide and had purchased a (supposedly) waterproof very expensive phone which was defective, and the manufacturer refused to repair or replace. I started reading up on BLU phones, and have now purchased three for myself and several for friends overseas. In total, have been using them for over three years now, all still work fine, and my only reason to replace has been to upgrade at only a fraction of the cost of several friends who spend hundreds of dollars yearly to upgrade."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",7-Feb-17,5,such a beautiful phone and works perfectly well,"such a beautiful phone and works perfectly well. It will take some time to figure out what all it has and how to make it all works, but as far as having a nice phone this is it. I bought one for me and one for my wife. The cameras are so amazing, very beautiful pics both front and rear and really nice selfie in not so great light. Nice phone. I'll comment later on as time goes by. My daughter got the Vivo XL LTE for christmas and we haven't had any trouble yet, works like a charm and my daughter works everything on it. Wonderful."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",27-Mar-17,4,"Good phone, good price, but no battery life","This phone has been a pretty easy phone to set up.  I still haven't gotten a memory card to work with it, but no more than I've used it so far it has sufficient memory.  I did have to but an adapter for the SIM card because mine was a micro mini.  Another reviewer highly suggested putting your SIM In second slot and memory card in the first.  Also I've had a terrible time getting it to carry through on calls in my car using bluetooth.  But a call to their help center suggested a hard reset and that fixed the problem.  I'm only giving for stars because the battery life is not the greatest and I don't know why they advertise it as a fast charge.  To get to full charge has taken an average of 3 hours!!  Over all for the price it's a nice phone and it comes with a case, head phones and a charger.  I'm not impressed with the case at all but have found reasonably priced ones on Amazon.Update:  I've had this phone for 4 months now.  It's plugged in more than it's  on my person!!  I've checked into getting the battery replaced but no one in my area carries the battery out can do it.  It takes an extremely long time to charge and a very short time to die."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Jun-17,1,The reason I’m giving a bad rating is their customer service,"The Vivo XL2 has meet all my expectations except for Bluetooth connectivity. It will not connect to my vehicles (two different vehicles) hands free Phone system. My family currently has a Blu R1 HD and Life XL phones that connect flawlessly to both vehicles. The reason I’m giving a bad rating is their customer service. I contacted their support team and this is their response” Thank you for contacting. Blu Products. We are happy to help you!

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",14-Apr-17,5,Five Stars,Runs smooth and has a clear screen.  I'll never buy an expensive ass Retail store phone again.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",22-Jun-17,5,"Nice phone, camera needs improvement, but the overall package is well worth the money","Overall it's a great phone, especially for the price. Before ordering, I was concerned about the screen resolution, but once it arrived and I started using it, I should say that paying more for a phone with a greater screen pixel count would be waste of money (at least for myself, as would not notice any difference). The screen resolution of this phone is just fine. Brightness is ok also, with no difficulty to read the screen when outdoors. The build quality of the phone looks good. Battery life is better than all the previous phones I had. I always charge it overnight, but it could go on for two days without charging (my previous Nexus 5 - the one from LG - wouldn't last until the evening). Sound quality is also better than expected. Speed is not great, but is more than satisfactory for everyday use. Also nice is the fact that it comes out of the box with a screen protector already fitted (plus a spare one in the box) and a nice protective silicone case. The only things I miss is an NFC reader. And the camera could be improved (focus is poor if you are shooting in low light conditions or close to the object). All the rest is just fine!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",27-Jan-17,5,"Wow, nice job Blu.","Received my Vivo XL2 earlier today.  Even though I just received it, I do have a few comments.  The unit itself is well done.  It looks much better than in the pictures.  One thing I've noticed with this phone and with my Vivo 4G LTE is that the screen stays cleaner than any other phone I've owned.  Presently I have a Nexus 6 and as good as it is, I'm constantly wiping the screen.  With the Vivo's, the screens repel smudges and prints extremely well.  The back isn't a fingerpring magnet either.  Yes, it gets prints on it but not near as bad as other phones that I've had.  Because of this and that I like the appearance so well, I've decided not to use the case on it.  I also ran the Vivo XL2 and Nexus 6 side by side and went through some apps (Google news, Radar Express, Weather) and in each case the speed was identical with both.On a negative note, I wish Blu would be specific in their information as to Sim size needed.  I couldn't find anything confirming that Sim 1 is a Nano Sim.  So I ordered a Nano to Micro Sadapter which I didn't need.  Sim 1 is a Nano sim card.Update 1-28-17  I needed to the permission requests before the ringtones would be made available.  I initially tapped deny but when I re-did it and tapped ok it gave me the build in ringtones.I did change the launcher to Google Now.  I mention that because with either launcher there are no ring tones except one in settings.  Can someone Confirm this for me and if this is the case, what is a good app to use for ringtones ??  Thanks"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-Feb-17,4,Four Stars,Very good phone
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",8-Jul-17,4,Good phone with a good price.,"This replaced my Blu Studio 5 phone. It is a bit more advanced and taking me some time to become more familiar with it. The extra 0.5"" inch screen is very nice. This is an Amazon sponsored product, so there are some apps that can't be removed, and I am getting too old to worry about monkeying around with the settings to allow getting rid of them. I have no problem recommending this phone. I use this with PureTalk USA which uses the AT&T network. I had a little problem figuring out placing the SIM and SSID cards in the phone, but I figured it out fairly fast."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",26-Jan-17,5,Pros Fast - With specs like what are listed what else do you expect,"ProsFast - With specs like what are listed what else do you expect? Phone does most of everything without missing a beatLook - Phone looks nice, I got the Gold and it looks very decent and not at all cheap lookingPrice - Got this on Amazon lightning deal for 99.99 and it's a steal for this price. Even for the full price it's not a bad deal for what you getSpecs - Very decent specs for what you pay for.  32 GB of storage space should be standard on most phones these days.ConsBeing nitpicky I'll name a few cons in the interest of being balance but these aren't major complaints I have but just complaints I can imagine people having.Screen - Not the resolution, the fact that it has a dark bezel around the perimeter of the screen inside the bezel so the screen doesn't extend right to the end of the bezel like with other higher end devices. Not sure if this is a design flaw or purposely made choice to keep price downCamera - Ok taking regular pics but don't expect ANYTHING like what you would get in higher end phones but then again for 99.99 I did not expect Iphone quality.UI Overlay - Blu should stick with making cheap phones and leave the UI building for higher end manufacturers like Samsung and others. Look at how long Samsung and HTC took before people took to their UI systems.  It's not a bad UI it's just not needed.Overall the phone is a real treat and I guess time will tell the full story on how long it lasts if it's treated properly.  For the time being though it seems to work very well."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-Feb-17,1,"No case, no parts... Be VERY VERY careful.","The first time I dropped this phone (which was the first day I owned it) the screen completely shattered. Of course that is my fault, but I had an iPhone 5 for two years before this and never broke the screen even though I dropped it many times. The Gorilla Glass 3 on this Vivo XL2 did not seem to help at all. Maybe the glass is just too wide to be so thin. Combine this with the fact that you cannot find a case for this phone yet (the one that comes with it is thin and useless) and you can't buy parts (except from the manufacturer who charges too much to justify repair)... and you would be wise to look elsewhere. I actually liked the phone, but with no available protective cases and no cost effective way to repair it, I wish I had bought something else."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",20-Sep-17,5,Yeah it works great. Granted I am bummed my other one (Vivo ...,"Yeah it works great.  Granted I am bummed my other one (Vivo XL) didn't last for more than a year... the power jack broke kinda which took out the cel antenna somehow. Outside of that it still works great, I use it as a tablet/MP3 Player now.  But anyway... this model Vivo XL2 works very well. Pretty much identical to the orig XL except it went back to the Micro USB jack instead of the USB-C jack like the XL has. One of the two SIM slots doubles as a micro-sd slot if you want extra storage. (Guess they had a location issue on the motherboard, which I find odd since they didn't have that problem with the XL)  They moved the camera to the top middle, added more on-board storage, and a little faster processor, and a IR blaster for using your phone as a TV remote.  The camera is a little better, and the sound quality is about the same as the XL model. The interface changed a bit too.. once I figured out how to turn off BLU's or Android's funky smart screen then it worked perfect for me. I like it.. I just hope it lasts for years and years..like five at least.  I never had a phone break down before five years before. Maybe because before I found the BLU phone I was dedicated to Samsung user.  But then Samsung started coming out with yukkie phones after the S4.  BLU makes some nice phones. They are getting there..Stylish and functional.  Especially the dual sim feature.  Worth every penny."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Oct-17,5,Outperforms its price tag!!,"Great phone for the money! Corning Gorilla glass, curved screen! This phone has a whopping powerhouse 1.4GHZ quad core processor, 3 gig of ram, and a 32 gig warehouse of storage for all your photos and memories! Weighing in at one pound, the phone is a little heavier than I'd like, but not really something that bothers me enough to remove a star. The Vivo XL2 gives you the quality, speed, and reliability of a Samsung Galaxy, for less than half the price! Comes pre-installed with Android 6.0 Marshmallow! Comes with screen protector and protective case."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",2-Sep-17,4,Awesome phone. Was sceptical when ordering,"Awesome phone. Was sceptical when ordering, but after using it for like 3 months I felt really pleased. Agreed it may not be the best phone ever, but then no mobile phone can be labelled- best phone ever! Many want a mobile that responds fast, and I tell you the Blu vivo XL 2 does just that, thanks to the 3gig RAM. The picture is sharp and the camera's got some nice features. Though some space out of the 32gig internal memory have been taken by applications, but there's still enough storage available for files-including videos, so if you are the type like me, that uses both SIM slots then you might not be bothered about an external SD card. One SIM slot is MICRO and the other is NANO, however you can only use one SIM slot if you intend on inserting an external SD card. Battery strength is 3150mAh, would have better if it were 5000mAh to help sustain the much needed apps on the phone. Comes with nice useful apps that helps you get updated. The head phone sound is clear, doesn't echo. Video resolution is crystal clear, nice to watch 🏠 of Cards😉. All in all it's a phone I'll recommend any day. A trial will convince you!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",22-Mar-17,5,Stop searching and just buy it! ;),"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!! this phone. It is everything I wanted, and more. I was hesitant at first, with it not being a ""name brand"" phone. I previously had a Droid turbo 2 with Verizon, but after having a couple of financial hardships I had to switch to a pay as you go plan. I didn't want to lose the luxury of my phone but I couldn't afford a high end Motorola. After reading all of the specs of this phone I decided I would take a chance, and I was not let down! I'm not one to write reviews but I believed that with this purchase I had to. This phone is AMAZING! the screen quality is excellent.  I love the smart gestures it reminds me of my Droid or a high end Samsung phone. It has a 32 gig internal memory and if that isn't enough then you can add a SD card for extra space, unlike my Droid or a newer Samsung phone. The function to connect to my TV is very handy. I haven't had a television remote in about two years, and I couldn't download an app to connect to it because I can't connect my tv to WiFi. I tried it believing whole heartily that it wouldn't work, and was extatic when it did. These are just a few of the many features that I love about this phone, and I fully believe it is just as high end as any Motorola or Samsung phone and for only a fourth of the cost. At this price YOU CAN NOT BEAT IT! stop searching and just purchase it! ;)"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",15-May-17,4,No verbal text message read out available when Bluetooth is connected in car.,"Greetings.This is a good phone however, the feature I looked forward to is not available.  The phone will not send text messages to be read  via the connection to the Bluetooth in my car.  This is a safety feature that I used frequently in my line of work.  If there is an upgrade to add this feature that would make this phone a GREAT device. If not, is there a different phone manufactured by BLU that has this capability?"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",13-Jun-17,5,Blu phones are awesome,"I upgraded from a Blu Advance 5.0 to this model and I couldn't be more happy. The 32 gb is more than enough storage but I added another 32 gb just in case I need it. Comes with a screen protector already on it and an extra protector for when you need to change it. It also comes with a rubber back case. I can do without all of the extra apps and wish manufacturers would stop forcing this stuff on us consumers. There is no way to uninstall the ones I don't want and some of them you can't even disable them. Other then that this is a great phone, I would highly recommend this phone as a great alternative to those expensive phones"

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",17-Jul-17,5,Little to no problems. Great phone!,"I actually loved the phone a lot. Great camera that satisfied me a lot with all the different options which me is great. The charging was fast, but what comes with fast charging also Comes with fast battery loss. The resolution of the phone is also great, but only a bit of lag, but not hard to deal with. I had very little problems. I wish I kept it safe if I didn't get it soaking wet. I loved the phone overall and will be buying it again. I love Vivo and for me being a teenager, I do use the phone very often And I'm surprised it didn't break down on me with my amount of use on it. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it does get very slippery because it is sleek and the steps to get to the home screen as well as watching videos using the phone's video viewing app which does show poorly. I do highly recommend though!"
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",29-Jan-17,5,... is my 3rd BLU phone and so far so good. I bought this to replace the R1HD and ...,"This is my 3rd BLU phone and so far so good.  I bought this to replace the R1HD and so far it is better on all levels as it should be.  The battery has lasted 24 hours with moderate use and still has over 50% left.  The OS doesn't exhibit any lag (yet) switching or running apps.  It does contain a compass sensor that allows you to use some navigation or star apps.  As with my experience with BLU phones, the camera is borderline terrible in all but bright sunlight.  The lock screen overlay is unusual but you can disable it if you choose.  The case it comes with is pretty lightweight and definitely won't protect it well with any falls onto hard surfaces.  I hope they make a more substantial case as an accessory.  The included screen protector also scratches very easily, but at least it comes with one.Bottom line, this is a solid midrange phone with a poor camera that doesn't break the bank.  The phones are cheap enough that you don't mind upgrading when next year's model comes out."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",6-Mar-17,4,Very good but room for improvement,"It's a good phone, hasn't let me down yet after about 3 months of owning it. Has some neat features and tons of space. The battery lasts fairly long on heavy usage. Takes nice photos and apps open very quickly. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is just some personal views preferences like the back doesn't come off which could be a problem down the road if I ever need to fix my phone. There's no app folder. All apps are on your screen. You can create folders to put your apps into but that'll remain on your screen so I can't hide any apps. Lastly this isn't a fault of the phone but this phone is very new and not really a major company so if you want a new phone case or screen protector you'll be very limited.Tldr: good phone overall. Neat features. Some personal preferences it does not fill for me. This is worth your money though."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Mar-17,2,Extremely. Disappointing.,"I had the Blu Vivo XL before buying this phone, and I absolutely LOVED everything about it. It was by far the best phone I've ever purchased, but because the charging port stopped working and the battery started acting up I NEEDED to order a new phone, and decided on the next line up.I love Blu's service. I love everything about this company.But, not even a week after I bought this phone the charging port for THIS phone started acting up. No joke. The entire reason I even bought this phone is because of charging port problems, and now I'm having them again??I know it's not the charger, it's the phone. And I don't know what to do. I'm just extremely disappointed."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",26-Mar-17,3,It's just kinda ok.,"There are a couple of issues with the phone that keep me from loving it. First and most obvious is the grip of the phone or the lack thereof. It is slippery...terribly slippery. Yes, it includes a hideous semi-clear silicone case but case options are minimal at best. Secondly the screen responsiveness could be better. I tend to miss type more on this phone than any other phone I've had and I often hit the wrong numbers when dialing. Another gripe is the lack of support for 5ghz wifi connection. Why? Just why? Other than that it's like every other Android with similar specs. Pretty good camera, fast enough, and fairly reliable."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",16-Jun-17,1,Slowest phone I've ever used,"My advice to all, please don't buy this phone. I purchased this phone right when it came out and have been using it for about 5 months now. The only thing that it has going for it is that it looks good. It's slow, apps launch without me touching them, the screen resolution is terrible, and for some reason the flashlight turns on randomly even though the screen is locked. I previously used a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge and bought this because it was cheap. I now know why the flagship phones are so expensive, you really do get what you pay for."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-Feb-17,4,Best Budget smart phone with 3gb ram and 32gb storage,"Wow, pretty sweet phone for about $100-150.  I don't have prime and got the phone in 7 days and of course it was package nicely from shipping and the GOLD box was also nice looking but it looks ultra taggy with the gold look on the entire box.  I really like the big battery on it.  The screen is great too at 720p so this will draw on battery less.  SD card and LTE support for TMobile a big plus.  So far so good but the Blu UI is a bit backwards but Google Now Launcher to the rescue.1 whole day of it and i'm pretty impressed by it."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",4-Oct-17,1,Great phone....while the month lasted,"I bought this phone month end July 2017...started using it August 10th. Bought it because of glowing reviews seen on Amazon.When I got it, I loved it! The phone was just like the people said. Loved the design, the graphics, storage space, though I hated the front camera (my blu life 8 was better).....Until last week (the week of September month end), I realise the phone will not charge. I decided to try charging it while off, it charged. After a couple days, the phone went blank and totally responsive. Felt it vibrate when I said 'ok google'...but otherwise dead phone.After googling my problem, I realised there were maaaannnnyyy reviews of persons having the same problem with the phone! Contacted the manufacturer as advised. The only option, return the phone to them for them to repair and return to me.  Told me the phone would need servicing! I live outside the US, it costs $$$ to send it back from where I am and I was also supposed to secure shipping to have it return to me! The length of time this would take equates to forever. I don't see why I should stand these costs only after having a 'brand new' phone for only a month and some weeks! No, sah! Blu could care less!This is my second Blu phone, the first lasted three years but after this, I'm done! Buy at your own risk."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",26-May-17,4,Good value for your money,"I've had this phone for almost two months. Overall, it seems like it is good quality for the price.This phone has several good points. It has a lot of memory storage for the price which I really like. I like keeping language learning apps on mny phone and always had a problem running out of memory on old phones. That has not been the case with this phone. I like the appearance of the phone and the screen is pretty clear. It also came with a free frosted case which was a nice bonus.The cons to this phone are the very quiet speakers and a tendency to freeze up. The freezing hasn't been a huge issue so far, and I'm not sure whether it's caused by bugs in the apps I use or the phone itself. However, the speakers are the quietest I've had on any phone."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",30-Oct-17,4,GREAT BUY!!,"Didn't look exactly as advertised.... but close enough. Everything included, as advertised. Surprisingly good speed for a device at this price. This phone is seriously outperforming its price tag! The only reason it's 4stars... is simply the physical appearance."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Nov-17,4,Competes With 500 Dollar Phones,"This phone is everything they say it is. It's every bit as good as a 500 dollar phone. That being said, I had issues with it at first being laggy and choppy. Then after a day or two, I got an alert for an android update. Once I got that installed, it worked really great! The camera is a little grainy in low light, but it takes great pictures. Great sound, the bluetooth and the apps work smoothly for streaming audio in my car. All around, it's a pretty good deal for the money."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",8-Apr-17,2,Bought it because I've been happy with other BLU products and this one has more ...,"Bought it because I've been happy with other BLU products and this one has more memory and RAM than the previous ones, so I thought what the heck. Well right off the bat I didn't like the launcher that it was loaded with. I turned that setting off after I finally found it. It is a beautiful phone but what's the point if you have to have a cover... and on this phone you HAVE to have a cover. Because of the shape and surface of it, it's like trying to hold onto a wet bar of soap. Lastly after using it for a couple months with no issues I notice some of my files just seem to disappear (pictures most noticeably) from time to time. I would not recommend this phone although I could understand why some people really like it, it's just not for me.Update 7.28.17..liking it less and less, in fact of the  three BLU phones I have (this one being the most exspesive of the three) I rarely use this one. Problems with Bluetooth compatibility. I rent cars regularly and most of the time my Vivo will pair with any car but while it allows me to stream audio, the phone function does not connect so, I can't make and receive calls through the vehicle system. I've tried several fixes but always the same results. I can not recommend this phone and I should have sold it when it was a newer modwl but my conscience wouldn't allow me to inflict it on some poor unsuspecting soul."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Jun-17,5,Great but why sacrifice the color,"Great phone got all the specs a moderate techy needs. Speaking as someone who went from the xl to this one though; the xl2 color sharpness is noticably weaker. I think it's a result of the much thicker Gorilla Glass which is too bad for me cause I don't need this Glass. The xl screen never scratched, even when in a pocket with my keys. It was also shatter resistant enough to go from car seat to concrete a handful of times with no damage so this thicker Glass seems unnecessary at least for my purposes. The colors by no means dull just a little weaker than the xl."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",18-Nov-17,1,"Good stats, nice phone, but RMA and customer service nightmare","This one looked really promising.  I'd purchased it as an upgrade for the Energy X Plus, which I absolutely loved.  However within one week of opening the box, the screen started going crazy.  I tried performing soft resets, hard resets, and factory reboots, even removing my SDCard from it.  None of this worked.  I contacted BLU's support team several times in a row and kept getting canned responses back (several days later) with instructions on performing a hard reset--which I already explained (in excruciating detail in the third time) that I had done.I was finally told that I might be eligible for an RMA.  The instructions for the RMA would require me sending the phone back to them at my expense, and that basically I would have to go without a phone for several weeks while they decided if it was a hardware issue or not--and that the replacement (or my original phone) would be sent back at my expense.  Part of my work involves doing RMAs routinely, and it's standard procedure with every vendor I deal with to send the replacement along with a waybill to send the original back, then to bill the customer for the difference if the issue appears to be customer-caused or the original unit is not received.  So this is shifting the cost of doing business off to the consumer instead of the company.  I'm glad of the price cut on these versus other companies, and I totally get there are trade-offs, but this one's just a bit steep for me.  I wouldn't mind paying a bit more if it meant having a phone that I can actually use and customer service interested in making sure that I can use what I buy from them.Look, I've had good success with Blu over the past few years, and I'm not meaning to dog them over this.  I've been a huge fan since the dual-sim capabilities let me carry both my work and personal phones in one package, which is a huge convenience.  But my experiences with this phone have really left a bad taste in my mouth after seeing what happens when the phone doesn't work, and I just don't think this is one that they'll recover from easily."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",13-Jul-17,2,Upon opening the package everything looks good considering the price,"Upon opening the package everything looks good considering the price.

I owned BLU phones in the past and this on I like the least. The battery(3150 non removable) is the biggest concern as you can barely make it through the day.I believe the battery is under sized for this model. Can get hot if your on a call for a while,I mainly use for calls.The ""start"" UI  can be trouble some when you password protect your phone. The 3GB ram  vs 2GB ram that is in the LifeMax not much different? Which I was using prior to XL2 .The 13MP camera takes nice pictures. The XL2 comes with headset, lightweight protective case and screen protector. The speaker can sound muffled. I like the slim and lightweight design. Internal memory 32 Gb and was able to add 64 GB Sd card.  All phones have their good and bad points. Overall not a bad phone."

Called the BLU phone customer service and they had me do a master reset but that didn't work either. The camera for some reason provided potato level quality on snap chat. Started to get slow after a couple days. It made a decent iPod for what its worth but not a phone that I was able to use. Returned the phone asap.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-Jun-17,1,You must send your phone to them for warranty work!,"Do not buy a phone from BLU.  Because, as they told me, they are a manufacturer and not a supplier, the first thing they will ask you to do is a hard reset on your phone.  You will lose everything.  All your contacts, apps, everything.  It will be the same as when you bought it.  Then, if that doesn't work you can start the warranty process.  You fill out a form and send it back, then you call them back, then you send your phone to them.  Yes, you read that part right.  Then,  in 10 to 15 BUSINESS DAYS they will let you know if they are going to replace it.  During this time and the transit time, you do not have a phone.  The only good thing I can say about them is they answer the phone quickly, but they are off-shore."

I like the gold color and he ordered the blue. The blue color appears a deep, deep blue black. The clear cover really takes away from the color. However, we love that we get covers free with the phones. I've had to send in my previous phone twice to Blu and the customer service is great! My phone was not able to be fixed and they sent a better, newer phone. They go above anything I've dealt with in years. My fiance drove off with his older phone on top of the car recently. It made it three miles before it fell off. We didn't know until later. It was dark and raining so we couldn't find it. Two days later he found his Blu phone wet, battery out and the phone in several pieces. The screen was cracked. He put it together after drying and it worked for a two months more! What a work horse for a phone. We are staying with Blu for both those reasons. You can't beat the price for the options on this phone."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",31-Oct-17,1,"BUYER BEWARE - BLU Products has a VERY, VERY bad warranty policy that you should consider before buying their products.","BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!Any ""physical damage"" to the phone - including superficial chips and scratches that do to affect product performance - WILL VOID THE WARRANTY.I purchased this phone on March 1st, 2017.  The phone worked well, and I like that it came with a free case and screen protector.  Up until, the phone fell out of my pocket and hit the ground.  The case fell off and the plastic edge of the phone suffered a minor chip.  The screen was not damaged and the phone worked perfectly fine afterward, so I decided to keep the phone and buy a better case for it.Fast forward to September 2017 - seven months after the chip occurred.  The phone starts acting weird - registering ""ghost touches"" - backing out of applications while I am using them.  So I emailed BLU customer support and they sent me instructions on how to do a hard reset.  I followed their instructions and performed the hard reset but the problem continued.  Next I called BLU customer support.  When I spoke to a representative, I was asked ""did the phone suffer and water damage or physical damage?""  I explained what had happened, the phone dropped, the case fell off, and the phone got a small chip in its case...  The CS rep told me that if the phone was subjected to ""any physical damage"" that the warranty was void.  I reassured them that the screen problem had nothing to do with the chip in the case - that the phone work perfectly for seven moths after the chip.  The CS rep instructed me to send a picture of the phone and a copy of my receipt so they could take a look.I took two photos of the phone - the first was a close up showing that the damage was just in the plastic case and the second was an overall shot showing how insignificant the chip was and what good condition the phone was in (see attached photos).  Needless to say, when I called back BLU Products denied my warranty claim citing ""physical damage"" to the phone.So I'm out $150 because BLU's case failed to protect the phone and I wasn't smart enough to return it to Amazon the minute it got chipped. (Again the case was defective.).So, please don't make the mistake I did.  Consider that if your phone get's so much as a scratch on it, BLU Products can deny any warranty claim regardless of if the scratch or chip has anything to do with the damage.Too bad.  I really liked the phone.  But the warranty policy is terrible."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",5-Apr-18,3,An okay phone that's not really worth buying at the end of the day...,"The phone is an ""OK"" product overall. The build of the phone is nice where it feels good in the hand and not too heavy to handle or difficult to engage comfortably. The screen resolution is probably one of the most pleasing offerings for a phone in the below $200 price range. Now to the bad parts. Although the phone has some positives it's the software and apps that really anchors down the score for me. When I first updated the software it functioned normally without much issue in the first day but after the second day everything collapsed pretty quickly. First, whenever I opened up an app it would take long to buffer and sometimes it would freeze and cancel. Other times, the apps would work for a good 15 mins and then it would slow down incredibly such as gaming apps for example. There were times when I would try to close an app like LinkedIN for example and the master 'back' button on the bottom of the touch screen would take 3 times until it finally backs out; that shouldn't happen. Speaker quality was okay, the sound didn't project loud enough for me and it was on one side of the phone which lacked the surround effect you would expect. Last, I would have issues receiving calls where it would redirect them to my voicemail without ringing my phone. And on top of that, I couldn't clearly hear the person when speaking to them which is like a basic essential for any phone. So overall, the phone is okay for the price but as they say you get what you pay for. Just look for other brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and Alcatel which are known to have good reviews."

This was a gift for my husband so I was originally happy with the additional accessories that was included with the phone, I was pleased I would not have to buy a case or screen protector until the phone screen shattered after the first drop. I carefully compared this phone to others and read the reviews and ratings. I also read in the details of the phone by the manufacture that the screen was made of gorilla glass, and that it was durable. That detail had to be false because after one drop from a couch to a hardwood floor should have not shattered the screen. I believe a case with a little lip on it could have prevented this accident.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",29-Mar-17,5,Experience from Egypt,I have bought this BLU from the US without even knowing about it before. However it is a very good device for all purposes. I do love it.Note:If u r taking it outside the states it is highly recommended to buy an extra charger.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",14-Dec-17,2,Like the phone .  .  . But .  .  .,"This phone has potential. Unfortunately, it is on the side of flimsy-ness. The remote control capability is cool.I would suggest a newer model. BLU phones sometimes have a solid internal frame. I exchanged this model for another. Grand XL LTE."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",27-Jan-17,5,Great phone great price,The phone is fast. It has good storage for the price you can't beat it. Works just as good as a more expensive phone. The camera is great. I got the phone on special for $99 but it's worth it even at the original$149 price tag.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",1-Nov-17,5,Excellent device!,This blu phone is actually very good. We have no complaints at all. Blu stepped up with this phone a lot. Easy to use. Camera quality is awesome.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",5-Jun-17,2,"While it started out fantastic, it has become slow and full of glitches","This is my 3rd blu Phone. While it started out fantastic, it has become slow and full of glitches.  It's at least 45 seconds before an outgoing call will connect and start to ring. I don't like that everytime I miss the space bar in the middle of a text I drag up the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth options. This is by far my least favorite blu phones. My wife has the same phone and can receive but not send pictures. They are lots of other things but it's time for me to get on with my day. I love a good deal, but sometimes you get what you pay for."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",5-Dec-17,1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"There is an class action suit regarding spyware installed in BLU phones. Even more awful, the recent OS update locked me out and I cannot use the phone! Resetting is an option, but I will loose all the data. Customer service is not good, slow to answer and not helpful at all."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",6-Jun-17,1,Not at all happy with this purchase,"Not at all happy with this purchase. Gets hot after 5 minutes in use. Dropping call, having problems connecting to internet."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Jul-17,1,It's unfortunate a phone with hardware and looks so good to have so many software problems,"I bought two units of this model, one gold and one gray. Both presented problems with touching ghosts and in the last week both lost the IMEI. It's unfortunate a phone with hardware and looks so good to have so many software problems. I bought BLU cell phones for six years and only in that year did I buy ten units, but after these problems I will not buy any more."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",27-May-17,3,Lacks SD card management,"Nice, fast, and useful phone but no way to access or manage SD card. It is more like an SD card holder than a useful slot."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",4-Nov-17,1,One Star,"Terrible, don't waste your money.  Too many bugs, not sturdy, doesn't charge. So many problems."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",4-Jan-18,3,Sd issues,I just got the phone yesterday . I was a little irritated with the sim and sd slot. I figured out how to open the tray but no directions how to place the sd and sims in the tray. The phone seems to function okay so far. The speaker is not that loud. Still not sure how to put my sd card in the tray.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Dec-17,1,Worst phone and customer service,Worst phone. Phone is only good for 5months then it's starts acting up.There customer service will tell you to send the phone to them to review it if it's under a year it can take them up to 15 days to review it and in those 15 days you are without a phone.I asked the lady in the case of an emergency what am I to do she said I need to figure it out.If you are ok with being without a phone for up to 15days and your phone stop working after 5months then this is the phone for you
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",3-May-17,5,So good so far,"So good so far, the mobile phone is absolutely amazing!! The camera is so clean and the image looks amazing, totally worth it the price!."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",28-Oct-17,2,I regret purchasing this phone,"I've had this phone for less than a year and I am already looking for a replacement. The phone comes with unremovable apps, one of which will pop up whole screen ads with no regards to what your trying to do at the time. The phone also stopped recognizing SD cards. Blu used to be an intriguing brand, but I'm off the bandwagon. This phone stinks. Avoid it."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",19-Nov-17,2,Good at first,I bought this phone March 2017 and it has been a great phone for the money up until just recently. The screen is damaged from the inside leaving a constant orange color on a portion of the screen. It has been in a case and has not been dropped or mistreated. I was going to buy a BLU phone again after this one got old but I haven't even had this one a year making me think the quality isn't that good.
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",24-Nov-17,2,If you use Wifi this may not be the phone for you. Wifi connection freezes frequently and have to reboot to get it working again,While this phone may be fine for international travelers or residents it doesn't work well for me.  Have to reboot 2 to 3 times a day to get wifi connection to work Bluetooth connection also drops frequently.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",23-Sep-17,2,resulted in some apps losing connectivity while others like chrome work fine,"This phone was released with various bugs and defects, latest update, marshmallow, resulted in some apps losing connectivity while others like chrome work fine. Also if the phone is impacted on the back by an object with little force there is a very good chance the back camera will stop working, this is very sensitive device, more than what is normally expected."

BLUs warranty plan is for you to send the phone to them and be without for 15-20 days. As someone who relies on my phone at work this is unacceptable customer service. The price seemed good for the phone, I now see why. You only get 8 months use."
"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Oct-17,1,Don't waste your money on this one,"Don't waste your money on this one. Have had many BLU phones in the past. This one is the worst. Ghost touch on the screen, always acting as if I am swiping down from the top of the screen. Some dead spots on the screen for touch also. The camera is horrible also. Cheap yes, but not worth even trying out."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Jan-17,3,Camera and display are unforgivable. Everything else is great!,"BLU phones are really their own identity when it comes to smartphones, from owning a few ""premium"" BLU products let me tell you what you're going to get, what I wish someone had told me before I bought mine.1) It's a good device for people who need a smartphone, not for people who want a great smartphone.2) The camera is completely useless, its actually embarrassing, if you plan to take and share images at all, you should not purchase a BLU phone.3) 720p is not at all an acceptable resolution for a 5.5 inch display. This is the same resolution as the iPhone which came out in 2010 (7 years ago). You will really see this in games and media viewing and it will be a constant reminder that you own a sub par phone.4) The screen will scratch with your fingernail, get a protector immediately.What I do like about BLU phones is that they are lighter than most phones, both physically and software wise, although there will be some miscommunication in settings due to grammatical errors and poor word choice. It charges fast, the os is clean, the buttons off screen are a blessing, and generous amount of memory keep it running fast for a very long time.In essence, it gets the job done, it just doesn't do it well. And for the price, you really can't expect it to."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",2-Feb-17,1,My Awful BLU Experience (College Student),"I never received my package in the mail for this product, it was noted online that it was delivered to someone yesterday night and has yet to show up. I dont know what happened with my 1 day shipping but I am furious. Along with this I made a previous purchase of the Blu Pure XL last summer and a little after three months of having it the phone would no longer charge I even went out of my way to buy new chargers and still it would not charge. I then contacted a few phone repair companies to see what they could do because I couldn't send the phone back due to it being past the 90 day period. So I called these repair companies hoping they could help since I had actually liked the phone but every single time I got a response of ""We don't repair Blu Phones"" or  ""We are unable to operate on that brand"". Now some people out there reading this review may think that I'm overreacting but I beg to differ quite honestly. Now what I have yet to mention is the phone I got right after the Blu Pure XL, which was the Blu Life One X2 first off I have to say this product started off proving to me that as crazy as it may sound Android Phones do in fact break. After receiving the product I accidentally dropped it on my carpeted floor in my college dorm. Now most people may be thinking your just clumsy but sure that may have been what I was at that moment but do you realized how astonished I was when I saw my screen cracked all over from landing on carpet. I dont know what it is with BLU right now but for me its not looking good I'll be back on here later to comment on whether or not I receive my package in the mail but unless my experiences with BLU improves I won't be recommending or buying anymore of their products especially if they cannot be repaired."

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",2-Feb-17,1,Dead Phone After a Week,"When I first received the phone, there was an inconsistent delay of when it would wake from when I pushed the power button (about 10 seconds).  It didn't happen frequently so I didn't think too much of it.  Then the phone started to randomly restart.  Usually, it would restart when the phone was sitting idle on a table.  The restarts became more frequent so I just ordered a replacement.  Though, today, the phone is now completely dead.  No indicator lights when plugged in and holding down the power button.We'll see if the replacement phone fares any better.UPDATE:The replacement exhibited the same issues as the first one but the issues have become less frequent the more I use it.  Very strange.  Hopefully, it lasts a decent amount of time.  At $100, it's a good deal as long as you can live with the random quirks but at $150, there are better phones out there."

Bluetooth doesn't work properly in the car which is a important thing.Badly works in the car I always have to restart the car to get the voice connect to car. WhatsApp audio doesn't work good.

"BLU VIVO XL2 - 5.5"" 4G LTE GSM",25-Jan-17,1,Really bad camera focusing,"Let me save you some grief. I have three Blu phones, one being the Vivo XL (previous version). They are a lot of phone for the money, but every one has flaws and customer service is non-existent. The big flaw with this series is the totally useless camera. Most of my pictures turn out blurry. Focusing was very slow and seldom worded. Worst camera I've ever had in a cell phone and I've mostly just stopped using it. I almost bought this update, hoping this was fixed. Well, google this phone and read the review at android guys: ""Action shots routinely came out blurry and the action was generally missed by a slower-than-optimal shutter when using HDR mode. The HDR mode was almost a must as pictures regularly came out under exposed in low-light situations. Decently lit scenes led to shots suitable for social media uploading, but not much else.""So if a decent camera is a must for you, stay away from this phone."
